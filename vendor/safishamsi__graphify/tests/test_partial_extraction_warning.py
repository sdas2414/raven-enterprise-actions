"""The partial-extraction warning must be actionable and must not misdirect.

It used to end in a hardcoded `(#2551)` for EVERY language. #2551 is closed and
Kotlin-specific ("bundled grammar rejects one-line type bodies"), so a reader
following the only lead the message offered landed on a resolved problem in a
different language — and at least one did, recording an Astro failure as
"already tracked upstream" on the strength of that number (#2788).

The message also could not distinguish a file that contributed nothing but its
own file node from one that yielded most of its symbols and lost an ERROR
region. Both rendered as "may be partially extracted".

Part 1 of #2788 — the Astro frontmatter parse itself — is NOT addressed here;
that belongs to the .svelte/.astro AST work in #2731.
