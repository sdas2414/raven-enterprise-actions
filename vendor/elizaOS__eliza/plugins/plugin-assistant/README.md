# @elizaos/plugin-assistant

Explicitly registered conversational behavior for the Node runtime.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-assistant build  # build
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-assistant test   # tests
```

The public OAuth provider catalog remains here; connection flows belong to
hosts, connectors, and cloud services. The unused OAuth callback bus and
plugin-configuration action plugin have been removed.

## Evaluator model selection

`ELIZA_EVALUATOR_MODEL` optionally requests a provider model only for completion
evaluation. The per-agent runtime setting takes precedence over the environment
fallback, which is used only when the runtime value is absent. Blank or
nonstring runtime values keep the existing slot and suppress that fallback.
An explicit nonblank `runEvaluator({ model })` takes precedence; blank is unspecified, not
an instruction to suppress the setting. Selection, including no override, stays
fixed through restoration and is resolved afresh on the next invocation.
Response handling, planning and extraction keep their own selections.
Provider adapters may ignore per-call selection or use their configured fallback;
recorded served-model metadata is
authoritative. Limits from a different slot model are not reused: unknown
capacity stays diagnostic and complete input reaches the provider unchanged.

## Resuming paused work

Resumption reloads the original selected domains through the current authorized
catalog, together with any newly selected domains. Saved tool schemas and prior
permissions are never reused. Missing or revoked domains stay unavailable;
`DISCOVER_ACTIONS` can retrieve other currently authorized operations. Original
outcome intents guide retrieval when the new routing decision supplies none,
while the complete checkpoint preserves receipts and prevents effect replay.

## Planner action discovery

`DISCOVER_ACTIONS` is a real per-turn `Action`, exposed to the planner as a native
function tool with typed arguments. It searches the registered action catalog;
it is not a prompt-only instruction or a second model call. Stage 1 chooses
contexts without receiving the action catalog. The planner can request more
operations throughout the turn.

Exact action hints stay selected. For other selected domains with pending
intents, the existing authorized retriever loads matching operations before
planning, avoiding a discovery round caused solely by an incomplete hint list.
Negated mutation clauses do not supply positive action hints.

Historical receipt wrappers may use compact row tables or position-preserving
shared legends when their shapes are uniform and the representation is smaller. Every value and source binding stays
available; original context events and restoration are unchanged. Shared source
review descriptions appear once in the planner instructions without weakening
the native tool schemas.

Use `query` and optional `contexts` when an action name is unknown. When contexts
are omitted, exact registered domain phrases or declared aliases in the query scope the search; the
result reports those inferred domains. Identifier fragments and path components do not
supply domain hints. Unresolved initial routing starts with discovery; explicit queries
without a domain retain global search, and explicit contexts or catalog reads remain available.
Explicit contexts accept registered aliases within the authorized catalog. Unknown
contexts stay restrictive; misses return authorized context names for correction. Search ranks
complete authorized operations and prefers matching operation names over
incidental words in long descriptions. Multiple requested operations remain
eligible. An unresolved family uses its authorized parent instead of loading all
siblings; exact child operations remain discoverable. Ambiguous wording falls
back to the existing lexical matches; a miss
means the query found nothing, not that the capability is unavailable.

Automatic initial selection and query/context search select at most ten complete
operation definitions, retaining domain coverage before filling remaining slots
by rank. Explicit Stage-1 hints remain selected even when they exceed that automatic
budget. Search reports total `matchCount`, `selectedCount`, and `deferredCount`;
`completeMatches` is false when any matching operations were deferred. Neither
the underlying catalog nor the ranker is capped. This bounds lexical/contextual
selection; it does not add vector retrieval or a semantic reranker.

Context-only loads rank against the current request and its selected outcomes;
context-only descriptions retain domain membership. Retrieval includes prior
dialogue for explicit continuations and source references, not merely a later
pronoun in a self-contained request. This ranking does not alter original dialogue
or its restoration.

The default `mode=load` enables the selected complete schemas in the next planner
round. `mode=describe` reads descriptions and schemas without enabling them.
Exact `names` load known operations or whole named families. `mode=describe`
with `names=[]` reads the complete authorized catalog; an empty load searches
for operations relevant to the current task. Exact-name and full-catalog requests
are not limited to ten; no selected definition is truncated. Search and exact
loads refresh permissions, and
execution checks them again. Discovery does not execute domain work. There is
one canonical planner discovery action. `SEARCH_ACTIONS` remains a cloud MCP
simile for connector discovery, not a separate planner registry;
`GET_ACTION_FROM_ALL` is not implemented. `DISCOVER_TOOLS` is its declared compatibility
simile: persisted or older model calls resolve to the same admitted action,
while new native schemas advertise only `DISCOVER_ACTIONS`.

Planner work continues across distinct operations and tool discovery by default.
Explicit `maxToolCalls` and `maxMemorySearchRounds` ceilings remain available;
discovery does not consume the domain-call ceiling. The default cumulative
prompt-token budget remains 1.5 million. Repeated failures, redundant mutations,
and repeated unchanged observations stop stalled work. A resource limit or
planner timeout returns an incomplete result with the full settled trajectory
and pending calls intact; it never reports earlier committed effects as undone
or automatically retries the turn.

The evaluator keeps one schema and instruction prefix across queue, receipt,
reply and host-effect changes. Current eligibility and exact source IDs follow
complete execution evidence. Runtime checks reject invalid queue/receipt IDs and
unsupported success; semantic outcome coverage can release an earlier pending
scope only when every declared intent has successful evidence and the full request
has been checked. Coverage is a model judgment, not independent execution proof.

## Reviewed history

A committed background retention review can provide a source-bound view of exact
original messages to the response handler and planner. It is not a foreground
completion certificate. Missing, stale or wrong-scope reviews retain full history;
constraints, uncertain/linked sources and unreviewed messages remain available.
The same validated view reaches action field extraction through the existing
request-bound dialogue handoff. Explicit full or invalid foreground selections
retain full-context fallback. Canonical events and historical effect outcomes
are unchanged. Explicit history
reads and restoration recover complete originals before dependent work. Initial
replies do not acquire a source-classification field or an extra review call.
After a successful native full-history read, the existing foreground selector
and exact source labels are offered together. A complete valid selection can
guide later stages; missing, stale or incomplete selections keep all originals.

Historical observations qualify only through exact operation declarations on the
registered action and canonical successful, non-replayed noop receipts. They
follow their original request through source-bound history selection and full
restoration. Mutation outcomes, undeclared operations and ambiguous bindings
remain inline; stored receipts are unchanged.

## Reviewed Clock handoffs

`@elizaos/plugin-assistant/device-clock-review` exposes the renderer-safe review coordinator. The host supplies durable approved-journal checks, one-use native consent, dispatch and receipts. Await `retire()` before changing the session owner; failed cancellation remains retryable. An opened receipt confirms dispatch, not final alarm state. Set, dismiss and snooze may mutate alarms immediately after approval.

`clock.handoff.v1` retains its one-off set payload without `days`. Explicit `days` requires `clock.handoff.v2`, including `[]` for one-off; daily is `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` and weekdays is `[2,3,4,5,6]`. Values follow [Android AlarmClock.EXTRA_DAYS](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/AlarmClock#EXTRA_DAYS), Sunday=1 through Saturday=7. The exact unique integer array stays bound to the approved proposal; unsupported capabilities or repeat patterns are rejected instead of discarding recurrence.

Run `bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-assistant test:clock-review-export` for source and packed-consumer checks. This uses a controlled host adapter and does not qualify Android Clock behavior.

`clock.alarms.v1` adds Eliza-owned native alarms through `clock_alarm`: set,
update, delete, enable, dismiss, snooze and show. It never opens an external Clock
app. Set and update require exact time, label, phone timezone and repeat days;
targeted changes require the current alarm UUID. The full authenticated phone
snapshot supplies current alarms and explicit schedule/permission states. A
stale or unavailable snapshot cannot prove the list is empty. Approval binds
the durable store's `alarmsRevision` as `clockContextRevision`; native dispatch
must recheck it. Applied typed receipts report actual saved or scheduled changes,
not proof that a future alarm will ring. Historical receipt retrieval performs
no new effect. Older `clock.handoff.v1/v2` clients retain their external handoff;
owned-alarm clients receive only the owned operation schemas.

## Authenticated device scope

Device enrollment retains the authenticated subject for approval review, claims and receipts. The host may separately bind a verified local OWNER enrollment to the canonical workflow owner; external identities and USER/ADMIN subjects keep their own scope. Request JSON cannot choose that owner. Nullable `workflow_owner_id` preserves legacy enrollment fallback.

An authenticated installation can read or revise its enabled-view subset at `/api/client-devices/view-profile`. Updates use an expected revision; empty subsets disable all view proposals, while a null legacy profile preserves existing behavior. Open-view proposals bind the current profile revision and revalidate at approval and claim. Per-turn tool schemas are cloned, so one installation cannot narrow another installation’s registered catalog. These restrictions do not authorize execution. Nullable `view_profile` migrates without replacing device keys or enrollment identities.

Run `vitest run --config vitest.device-actions.config.ts` from this package for real HTTP/SQL device lifecycle, workflow-owner dispatch/receipt and additive-migration scenarios.

The package root exports the memory, knowledge-delivery and notification actions.
Hosts explicitly compose them; importing the package does not install those
actions or change an existing host's selected behavior.
