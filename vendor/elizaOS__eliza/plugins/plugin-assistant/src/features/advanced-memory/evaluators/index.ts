/**
 * Barrel for the advanced-memory `longTermMemoryEvaluator` and its
 * `memoryItems` bundle — consumed by
 * `createAdvancedMemoryPlugin`.
 *
 * Uses direct import + re-export rather than `export { … } from` so Bun.build's
 * tree-shaker cannot elide the value bindings: the pure re-export form produced
 * an empty module init in the mobile agent bundle, crashing the runtime with
 * `ReferenceError: memoryItems is not defined` when the plugin referenced the
 * binding.
