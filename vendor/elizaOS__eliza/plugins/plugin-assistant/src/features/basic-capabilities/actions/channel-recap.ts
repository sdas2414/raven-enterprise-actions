/**
 * CHANNEL_RECAP — reads back the stored message history of the room the
 * triggering message arrived in, so a group-chat sender can ask for a recap,
 * summary, or "the last N messages" of their own channel. Live evidence
 * 2026-08-21: that ask routed to contexts=["general"], whose planner surface
 * carried no message-history tool (SEARCH_MESSAGES lives behind the ADMIN
 * messaging/email umbrella), so the agent honestly refused a request whose
 * content every room participant can already scroll.
 *
 * Room scoping is structural, not parametric: the handler reads only
 * `message.roomId` and exposes no room/channel selector, so a request from
 * room A can never return room B content and cross-room/inbox-wide search
 * stays gated on the messaging umbrella exactly as before.
 *
 * PROMPT-INTEGRITY (PR #26780): the requested range is served COMPLETE — every
 * rendered message carries its full stored text, chronologically ordered, with
 * no deliverable ceiling and no storage read bound; application-authored
 * size/item caps are banned. Storage traversal is exhaustive: keyset pages
 * (createdAt+id cursor) are pulled until the requested dialogue range is
 * satisfied or the store runs out, and store exhaustion is disclosed in the
 * result. A range too large to send to the model is NOT this action's
 * problem: the provider's documented context limit is the one real resource
 * boundary, and the dispatch-side overflow boundary owns that rejection.
 *
 * DIALOGUE HYGIENE vs application caps — the distinction matters: rows pass
 * through the canonical RECENT_MESSAGES dialogue-hygiene boundary
 * (`isHygienicDialogueMessage` + `dedupeHygienicDialogueMessages`, imported —
 * never forked — from recentMessages.ts) BEFORE they count toward the
 * requested depth. That boundary is the repo's model-exposure contract: it
 * strips what was never legitimate conversation (the agent's own
 * action_result records, internal bridge relays, synthetic assistant failure
 * replies, transient status posts, leaked tool transcripts, local-path
 * dumps). Only identical copies of the same stored record are deduplicated;
 * distinct message occurrences remain. Machinery cannot be laundered back to
 * the model — or to the user — through a recap. It is NOT an application
 * size cap: every row that survives hygiene is still served complete and
 * bounds-free, and hygienic rows are back-filled from older pages so
 * stripped rows never shrink the delivered range.
