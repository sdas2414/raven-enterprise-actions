/**
 * SendPolicy hook — lets a host runtime gate outbound sends behind owner
 * approval (or any other policy). Triage's MESSAGE consults the registered
 * policy before invoking the adapter.
 *
 * Registration uses a module-scoped WeakMap keyed by runtime instance so the
 * hook lifetime tracks the runtime and we don't leak across tests. We do not
 * use runtime.registerService here because SendPolicy is not a long-lived
 * background Service — it's a per-runtime hook with two methods.
