 * object — strict-grammar providers reject an empty `properties` shape — and
 * carries an optional `completed` signal the post-tool gate uses to decide
 * whether to fall through to a full evaluator pass. Native function-calling

- Follow the supplied reply-only context-access protocol if original history or deferred provider details are needed. That read restores context without replaying any effect.
- Include requested actual output, exact values, links and relevant failures; do not replace results with a description of having fetched them. Prefer verified user-facing tool text when suitable.

- Use only the tools array; build the smallest grounded queue covering every explicit requested outcome.

- routed action: set parameters.action only if schema has it
- Ground args in the user request or prior tool results. Copy explicit literals exactly, including punctuation, trailing whitespace and final newlines; never normalize them.
- obey schema; arrays as JSON arrays, not comma strings
- no empty strings/placeholders/invented required args; gather via grounded tool or no tool
- For currently authorized work, call a matching tool even with missing details; its handler owns required clarification and validation. Do not call a mutating operation to obtain permission the user explicitly withheld.
- Currently authorized life-management side effects (calendar events, reminders, alarms, todos, routines, goals, scheduled/recurring tasks) require the matching exposed tool before reporting completion. Match its name, routing hint and description, not a fixed required name. A tool-owned conflict, clarification, preview or confirmation result does not prove an effect happened; an operation that always commits is not a preview operation.
