// Actions the planner selects as explicit delegation / orchestration intent.
// These cannot be evaluated by keyword-overlap against the user's message
// (e.g. "build me an app" does not contain "spawn" or "agent"), so the
// metadata-based corrector must not override them with a keyword-matched
// alternative like a cross-channel send action.
//
// WORKFLOW + its trigger schedule similes are included because the phrase
// structure the planner matches on ("every N minutes", "at 7am daily",
// "schedule a cron task") does not keyword-overlap with the action's
// description the way owner reminder/todo prose does.
// Without these entries, the metadata-overlap correction path routinely
// overrides a correct CREATE_CRON / WORKFLOW pick on
// page-automations with owner task actions based on fuzzy description overlap — breaking
// the scope-gated routing on the page-automations surface.
// CONTACT/ENTITY are explicit umbrella actions for contacts /
// rolodex / follow-up surface. The metadata-based corrector would otherwise
// override a correct contact follow-up pick with
// SCHEDULE_FOLLOW_UP based on keyword overlap ("follow up with X next week"),
// creating a task on the wrong surface. Treat CONTACT and ENTITY as explicit
// planner intent so the corrector does not second-guess them.
//
// START_CODING_TASK is the orchestrator's coding-sub-agent delegation. When a user
// says "build me X" or "implement Y", the planner correctly picks START_CODING_TASK,
// but the user's prose contains zero START_CODING_TASK keywords. Without this entry
// the corrector overrides START_CODING_TASK with whatever role-gated action
// (CALENDAR, MESSAGE, MANAGE_ISSUES) happens to overlap with
// incidental words in the prompt — e.g. a build request that mentions a date
// keyword-rescores CALENDAR over START_CODING_TASK and the user gets
// "Google Calendar is not connected" in response to a code request. Same
// precedent as SPAWN_AGENT, the sibling delegation action that's already
// protected here.
//
// Media and advertising actions are also explicit artifact-producing intent.
// Requests like "generate an image", "make an ad creative", or "publish the
// ad pack" can contain generic workflow/productivity words that fuzzy metadata
// scoring over-values for owner/life actions. If the planner already selected
// a concrete media/ad action, do not rewrite it to LIFE/CALENDAR/etc. based on
// incidental overlap.
