/**
 * Startup reconciliation of status reactions stranded by an unclean shutdown
 * (elizaOS/eliza#16318).
 *
 * The shutdown drain (#17749) reconciles reactions for turns it can observe,
 * but a hard-killed process (SIGKILL, OOM) never runs that path: the bot's
 * ⏳/🤔 stays on the message forever and the bot looks stuck. This scan runs
 * once per account after the client is ready and removes the bot's own
 * in-progress markers from recent messages. It removes rather than swaps to
 * ❌: by the time the process is back, the message may already have been
 * re-sent and answered, and stamping a retroactive error onto an old message
 * misleads more than a quiet cleanup.
 *
 * Every dimension is hard-capped (channels, messages per channel, message
 * age, wall-clock budget) so the scan completes quickly on large guilds, and
 * every failure is counted and logged with channel context, never thrown:
 * this runs detached from the ready path, where a rejection would be treated
 * as a terminal login failure.
 *
 * Discord's bot API cannot enumerate existing DM channels. The DM leg can
 * therefore scan only channels already present in `client.channels.cache`
 * plus any DMs re-opened from the persisted registry (elizaOS/eliza#18746);
 * after a cold restart the cache may be empty until a DM gateway event
 * arrives. DMs are scanned before guild channels so the shared channel cap
 * cannot starve DM coverage.
 *
 * The scan must never eat a marker the CURRENT process just placed: message
 * listeners bind before login resolves, so a turn can start (and stamp ⏳/🤔)
 * before this scan runs. Two guards enforce that: messages created at or
 * after the scan started (minus a small clock-skew allowance) are skipped,
 * and the caller may pass `isTurnActive` so message ids tracked in the live
 * turn-drain registry are excluded regardless of timestamp.
