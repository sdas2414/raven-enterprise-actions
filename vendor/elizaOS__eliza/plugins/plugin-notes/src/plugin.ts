For field replacement supply changes entries (field, value) and notesRevision from the complete commit/read snapshot as expectedRevision. CREATE includes its exact transaction revision. Never guess the revision. Any intervening Notes mutation, including deleting another note, requires a fresh complete read and reconciliation. Body value excludes bodySeparator but preserves every authored leading newline and space. The store adds one framing newline; do not include the separator in the replacement. Omitted fields remain unchanged; replacing a body does not require rewriting its title.
