 * SAVED_NOTES — the read seam that makes a saved note recallable in chat.
 *
 * `NotesService` is the only durable home for notes, but nothing ever put its
 * contents in front of the planner: a recall question routed to MEMORY_SEARCH,
 * which scans runtime memories and cannot see this store. Live capture
 * 2026-08-14 — a note reading "alex is my cofounder and we met at ethdenver"
 * was on disk while "who is alex again" answered "Found 0 memory item(s)"
 * twice, because the two stores never meet.
 *
 * This provider renders the canonical snapshot at read time and keeps nothing.
 * `NotesService` therefore stays the single source of truth: an edited or
 * deleted note cannot linger here the way a mirrored memory record would.
