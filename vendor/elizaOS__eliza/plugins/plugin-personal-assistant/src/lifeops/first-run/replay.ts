/**
 * First-run replay semantics.
 *
 * Replay = re-run the first-run flow without destroying anything:
 *   - Existing `ScheduledTask` records are NOT touched. The runner sees the
 *     same `idempotencyKey` and upserts in place.
 *   - `OwnerFactStore` facts that the questions touch ARE updated. New
 *     answers append; previously-answered fields show their current value as
 *     the "default" for the user to confirm or change.
 *   - `partialAnswers` for the in-progress lifecycle is reset on entry —
 *     replay always starts a fresh answer slate (the user can still skip
 *     unchanged questions).
 *
 * This module exposes the read-only helpers replay uses to surface current
 * facts as defaults.
