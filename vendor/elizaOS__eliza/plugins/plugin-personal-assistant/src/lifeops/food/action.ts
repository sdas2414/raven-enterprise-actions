/**
 * Owner conversational surface over the food domain: household profile, hard
 * constraints, preferences, inventory observations, deterministic meal
 * evaluation, plan publishing, and the approval-bound shopping handoff.
 *
 * Publishing and handoff requests never accept a model-authored evaluation.
 * The handler recomputes the canonical evaluation from current repository
 * state and requires the planner to echo the contentSha256 the owner already
 * reviewed, so what ships is exactly what was evaluated — a changed
 * constraint, preference, or pantry state surfaces as an explicit stale
 * rejection instead of silently publishing different content. Approved
 * handoffs are materialized elsewhere (RESOLVE_REQUEST), never here.
