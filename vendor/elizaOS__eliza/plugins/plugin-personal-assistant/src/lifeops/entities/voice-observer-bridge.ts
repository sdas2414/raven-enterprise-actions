/**
 * Runtime bridge: connect the core `VOICE_TURN_OBSERVED` event to the
 * LifeOps `VoiceObserver` (the merge-engine path), and emit
 * `VOICE_ENTITY_BOUND` back so the voice-profile owner can persist the
 * binding.
 *
 * This is the production wiring that was missing: `VoiceObserver` and
 * the merge engine (`EntityStore.observeIdentity`) existed and were
 * tested, but nothing drove them at runtime. A voice/speaker-ID plugin
 * (plugin-local-inference) emits `VOICE_TURN_OBSERVED`; this handler
 * folds the turn into the entity + relationship graph and round-trips
 * the resulting entity id via `VOICE_ENTITY_BOUND`.
 *
 * No plugin imports the other: the only shared surface is the core
 * event seam. If plugin-local-inference is absent the emit is a no-op;
 * if plugin-lifeops is absent the observation simply has no consumer.
