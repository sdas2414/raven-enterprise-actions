/**
 * Notification-priority tiering for reminders pushed onto the unified rail
 * (#10697). Calendar-event reminders were all emitted at a single fixed
 * `priority: "normal"`, so "starting soon" and "tomorrow" looked identical on
 * the notification surface. This tiers a calendar reminder by how far away the
 * event actually starts:
 *
 *   - starting SOON (≤ {@link REMINDER_SOON_WINDOW_MS}, incl. overdue) → "high",
 *   - TOMORROW / further out (≥ {@link REMINDER_DISTANT_WINDOW_MS})    → "low",
 *   - later today (in between)                                        → "normal".
 *
 * Occurrence reminders use "high" so timed alerts share the same priority on
 * foreground and background notification surfaces.
 *
 * The event start time is the reminder's `dueAt` — for a `calendar_event` row
 * `dueAt` is set to `event.startAt` (the nudge's own fire time lives in
 * `scheduledFor`), so `dueAt - now` is the true lead time to the event. Pure +
 * time-injected so it unit-tests without a clock.
