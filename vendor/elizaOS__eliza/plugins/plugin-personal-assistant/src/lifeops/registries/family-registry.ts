/**
 * FamilyRegistry.
 *
 * Lifts the closed `LIFEOPS_TELEMETRY_FAMILIES` discriminated union into an
 * open registry of namespaced bus-family identifiers. The closed union still
 * encodes the canonical telemetry payload schemas in
 * `packages/core/src/contracts/lifeops.ts` for the built-in 11 families;
 * the registry tracks every family that flows through the activity-signal
 * bus, including new namespaced contributions like `health.sleep.detected`,
 * `calendar.meeting.ended`, etc.
 *
 * Family-name convention:
 *   - built-ins: lower-snake-case (`device_presence_event`, `manual_override_event`).
 *   - namespaced contributions: dotted, lower-case (`health.sleep.detected`,
 *     `calendar.meeting.ended`, `time.morning.start`).
 *
 * The registry is per-runtime and validates membership at runtime; producers
 * push events through `ActivitySignalBus` (see `signals/bus.ts`) which
 * consults the registry.
