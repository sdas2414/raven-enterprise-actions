/**
 * `pendingApprovals` provider — surfaces the owner's PENDING approval-queue
 * rows (gated sends, signatures, bookings, calls) so the router and planner
 * can see that a queued request is awaiting a decision and route the owner's
 * approve/hold/reject through RESOLVE_REQUEST instead of a plain reply.
 *
 * Without this live view the model has no in-prompt signal that a queue row
 * exists: an owner saying "don't send it, reject that for now" reads like
 * conversation, the reply confirms a hold, and the approval stays `pending`
 * forever (#14630). The provider is `alwaysInResponseState` because Stage-1
 * routing names candidate actions before context routing has run — the queue
 * must be visible on the turn where the decision arrives, whatever contexts
 * that turn classifies into. The happy-path render is empty and the read is
 * one bounded SQL, per the always-on provider contract.
