/**
 * Onboarding journey — customize path under the three-question contract
 * (#14691: preferredName → categories → channel; timezone/windows inferred,
 * relationships discovered passively). A fresh owner opts to customize; the
 * LIVE message turns exercise the model with the onboarding affordance
 * surfaced (recorded trajectory = the "walk the user through" evidence),
 * while the final check drives the real `FirstRunService` through the walk,
 * passing the timezone/windows/follow-up cadences the owner VOLUNTEERED in
 * speech as volunteered input fields.
 *
 * Pass/fail is the DOMAIN outcome, not chat text (first-run is conductor-driven,
 * not model-invocable): the final check asserts the seeded default pack in the
 * real scheduled-task store, anchored to the volunteered morning window, via
 * `LifeOpsRepository`.
 *
 * Fail-without-fix anchor: `FirstRunService.runCustomizePath` +
 * `nextCustomizeQuestion` (`src/lifeops/first-run/service.ts`,
 * `.../first-run/questions.ts`).
