/**
 * A2 adhd-follow-through (live). Two stalled items are being chased, so
 * Casey's "stop bugging me about that one" is underdetermined. Guessing here is
 * uniquely costly: silencing the wrong chase drops the item that most needed
 * the nudge, and Casey will not notice the loss until the deadline passes.
 * One focused clarifier must come before any chasing is altered.
