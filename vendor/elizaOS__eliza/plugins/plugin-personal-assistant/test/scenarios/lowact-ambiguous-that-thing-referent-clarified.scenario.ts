/**
 * E1 low-activation-reengagement (live). tara_low refers back to "that thing i
 * said i'd do" while two tiny commitments are on file, so the referent is
 * genuinely underdetermined. The clarifier has to stay gentle and singular — for
 * this persona an interrogation or a re-listing of everything outstanding is its
 * own failure mode, so the rubric grades tone alongside the disambiguation.
 *
 * NOT a crisis guard: ordinary low activation, never a 988/crisis effect
 * (#12780 not-planned).
