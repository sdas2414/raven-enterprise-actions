/**
 * Onboarding journey — channel answer for a channel with no connected
 * dispatcher. The owner picks a notification channel (telegram) that is not
 * connected in this runtime; onboarding must record the choice with
 * `fallbackToInApp: true` and surface a warning rather than silently promising
 * delivery it cannot make. The LIVE message turn records the model's handling
 * (trajectory evidence); pass/fail is the DOMAIN contract, since first-run is
 * conductor-driven, not model-invocable. The final check asserts both the raw
 * `validateChannel` contract and that the surfaced first-run result carries the
 * fallback warning + a "(fallback)" completion message, then confirms the
 * default pack still seeded.
 *
 * Fail-without-fix anchor: `validateChannel` + the `ChannelInspector`
 * connectivity check (`src/lifeops/first-run/questions.ts`, header contract)
 * and `installFirstRunChannelInspector` (`.../first-run/channel-inspector.ts`).

Acceptable passes include noting Telegram isn't connected yet (offering in-app delivery meanwhile or steps to connect), or proceeding with setup while being non-committal about the delivery channel. Fail if it flatly claims nudges will arrive on Telegram with no caveat, refuses setup entirely, or dumps internal jargon (task ids, cron/ISO formats).",
