/**
 * B2 shift-rotation ambiguity. On a night rotation, "tomorrow" spoken at 03:00
 * is genuinely underdetermined: the calendar day has already turned, so it can
 * mean the daylight hours a few hours from now (before Marcus sleeps) or the
 * waking period that follows his daytime sleep. A day-boundary assumption is
 * the classic shift-worker failure, so the assistant must resolve the referent
 * before moving anything. The owner's turns stay vague on purpose — the pass
 * criteria live only in the judge rubrics.
