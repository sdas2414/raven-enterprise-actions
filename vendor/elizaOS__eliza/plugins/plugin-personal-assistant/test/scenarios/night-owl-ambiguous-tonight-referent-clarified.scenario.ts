/**
 * B1 night-owl ambiguity. For an owner whose day runs past midnight, "tonight"
 * spoken at 02:00 splits: it can mean the session already in progress on the
 * far side of midnight, or the next one after she sleeps. Two seeded blocks sit
 * on the two candidate dates, so the referent is genuinely underdetermined and
 * a calendar-day assumption silently targets the wrong one. The owner's turns
 * never state the rule — the clarifier has to come from the assistant.
