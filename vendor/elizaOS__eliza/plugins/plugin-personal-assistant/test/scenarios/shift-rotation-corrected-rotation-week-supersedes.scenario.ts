/**
 * B2 shift-rotation self-contradiction. Marcus states the week his nights
 * start, then corrects it mid-thread without saying "replace the old one". A
 * rotation that exists twice with two different start weeks is worse than no
 * rotation at all: every downstream anchor (sleep protection, post-shift
 * reminders) would resolve against whichever copy is read first. The correction
 * must supersede in place, and the owner never spells that requirement out.
