/**
 * C1 traveler ambiguity. A bare clock time from someone mid-itinerary carries
 * no timezone: "nine" can mean the zone she is standing in, the zone she lands
 * in, or the counterparty's. Two seeded calls sit on either side of the hop, so
 * the referent is genuinely underdetermined and a silent zone assumption is
 * exactly the failure this persona exists to catch. The first turn withholds
 * both facts; the clarification then names the destination and local clock.
