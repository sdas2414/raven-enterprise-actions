/**
 * Onboarding journey — fast-start (defaults) path. A fresh owner asks to be set
 * up quickly. The message turns run against the LIVE model with the
 * `firstRunProvider` affordance surfaced (the seed restores fresh `pending`
 * state), so the recorded trajectory shows the live model engaging with
 * onboarding — the "walk the user through" evidence.
 *
 * Pass/fail is the DOMAIN outcome, not chat text: first-run is conductor-driven,
 * not model-invocable (no planner action seeds it), so the model's improvised
 * reply is not the asserted contract. The final check drives the real
 * `FirstRunService` through the production runner (the seam the in-chat
 * conductor uses) and asserts `app_lifeops.life_scheduled_tasks` via
 * `LifeOpsRepository`: the default pack (gm/gn/checkin/morning-brief)
 * materializes and the gm reminder's cron is anchored to the answered wake time.
 *
 * Fail-without-fix anchor: `FirstRunService.runDefaultsPath` + `buildDefaultsPack`
 * (`src/lifeops/first-run/defaults.ts`).
