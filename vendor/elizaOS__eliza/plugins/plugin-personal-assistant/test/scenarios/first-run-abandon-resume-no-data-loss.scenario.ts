/**
 * Onboarding journey — abandon mid-customize, then resume without data loss.
 * The owner answers the first two customize questions, walks away, and comes
 * back later. The LIVE message turns show the interruption + return (recorded
 * trajectory evidence); pass/fail is the DOMAIN durability contract, since
 * first-run is conductor-driven, not model-invocable. The final check proves it:
 * a fresh `FirstRunService` instance reads the persisted `partialAnswers` and
 * resumes at the first UNanswered question (categories) instead of re-asking the
 * name or windows, and the flow still reaches a real seeded first reminder
 * anchored to the earlier answer.
 *
 * Fail-without-fix anchor: `FirstRunStateStore.recordAnswer` / `.abandon`
 * persistence (`src/lifeops/first-run/state.ts`) and the resume merge in
 * `FirstRunService.runCustomizePath` (`persistCustomizePartials` +
 * `nextCustomizeQuestion`).
