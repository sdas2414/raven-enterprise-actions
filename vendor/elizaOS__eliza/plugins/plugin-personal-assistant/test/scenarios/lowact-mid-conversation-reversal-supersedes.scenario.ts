/**
 * E1 low-activation-reengagement (live). tara_low asks for one tiny evening
 * step, then reverses to mornings a turn later. For this persona a duplicate is
 * worse than a miss: two standing nudges for the same intention read as a
 * growing pile and are exactly what drives disengagement, so the reversal must
 * replace the first step rather than sit beside it.
 *
 * NOT a crisis guard: ordinary low activation, never a 988/crisis effect
 * (#12780 not-planned).
