/**
 * B1 night-owl self-contradiction on the wake anchor. Noor gives a waking time,
 * then walks it back mid-thread without asking for anything to be replaced.
 * Everything in her day hangs off one wake anchor, so a second anchor left
 * standing beside the first makes every relative reminder resolve
 * nondeterministically. The correction must supersede in place; she never says
 * so, and the requirement lives only in the rubrics.
