/**
 * A1 adhd-capture-and-start (live). Casey commits to a Saturday errand, then
 * reverses it two turns later once the real constraint surfaces. Unlike the
 * in-message "wait no" correction, the reversal arrives after the capture has
 * already landed, so the assistant has to supersede an existing item rather
 * than treat the second ask as a new commitment. Leaving both is the failure
 * mode this row exists to catch: for an ADHD owner, a stale duplicate reminder
 * is worse than none, because it teaches them to ignore the whole channel.
