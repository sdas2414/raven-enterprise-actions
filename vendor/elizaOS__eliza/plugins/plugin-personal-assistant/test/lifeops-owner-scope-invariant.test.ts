/**
 * Owner-scope parity across the LifeOps identity surfaces: the chat write path
 * (`resolveClientChatAdminEntityId`), the HTTP read path (route
 * `LifeOpsService` with no explicit owner), the scheduler
 * (`runLifeOpsScheduledWork` constructs `new LifeOpsService(runtime)`), and the
 * trust/escalation fallback (`resolveFallbackOwnerEntityId`). All must derive
 * the same owner `subject_id` in every provisioning state, or rows written on
 * one surface are invisible to the others: the write side used to seed its
 * fallback UUID from the agent NAME while reads and the scheduler seeded from
 * the agent ID, so every chat-created reminder landed in a scope no reader or
 * scheduler ever scanned. Real service construction against the minimal
 * runtime stub with a real-UUID agent id; no mocks of the code under test.
