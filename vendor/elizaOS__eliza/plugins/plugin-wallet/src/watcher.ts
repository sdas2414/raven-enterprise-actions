/**
 * Producer-side wallet balance-delta notifications. The home spec demoted the
 * `wallet.balance` resident card (NOTIFICATIONS-WIDGETS-SYSTEM.md §B/§E item
 * 3): the routed wallet view keeps the price surface, and "something changed
 * with your money" travels as a notification instead of resident chrome. This
 * module is that promised producer (#16943): a structural `kind: "watcher"`
 * ScheduledTask on the one scheduling spine samples the wallet's total USD
 * balance on an interval and, when it moved materially since the recorded
 * baseline, emits a `general` notification through NotificationService.
 *
 * Structural behavior only: the fire rides a contributed dispatch channel
 * (`registerScheduledTaskChannelDispatcher`), the same seam the coding-agent
 * pr-shepherd recipe uses — the task's `promptInstructions` is never rendered
 * or routed on. The notification copy is deterministic and deliberately
 * amount-free (percent only): notifications surface on lock screens of
 * shared/kid devices, so dollar figures stay in `data` for in-app consumers,
 * matching the spirit of the price-only widget invariant (#10706).
 *
 * Error doctrine: "couldn't read the balance" must never read as "balance is
 * zero". A failed leg fetch surfaces as a typed retryable dispatch failure
 * (the runner's dispatch policy retries the same step), and a change in WHICH
 * legs are samplable (chain errored, RPC readiness flipped, address
 * added/removed) re-baselines silently instead of fabricating a delta. The
 * same doctrine covers price availability: the upstream balance stack encodes
 * "price unknown" as `valueUsd: "0"` with no error (wallet-evm-balance.ts
 * seeds "0" and only overwrites on a dex-price hit; wallet-dex-prices.ts
 * swallows provider failures into a partial map), so a dexscreener /
 * geckoterminal outage collapses totals to ~0 while unit balances are
 * unchanged. Price coverage is therefore tracked PER POSITION: a
 * priced↔unpriced flip on a position both samples hold is a sampling change
 * on THAT position only, not a balance move. The baseline records each
 * position's USD value alongside its coverage bit so a flip excises just the
 * flipped positions from both totals and compares the residual — re-anchoring
 * the whole total on any flip would hand anyone who can time a price listing
 * on a spam token (fake-liquidity dexscreener pump) a mute button for a
 * concurrent real crash, and would let one flapping dust position re-anchor
 * the drift accumulator every tick. When the residual holdings did not move
 * materially, only the flipped contribution is re-baselined, and a run of
 * consecutive flip re-baselines is escalated via `runtime.reportError` as a
 * systemic price-feed problem instead of flapping silently at debug forever.
 * The guard stays scoped to positions the baseline knows: a NEW unpriced
 * position (spam airdrop) contributes $0 to the total, leaves the priced
 * holdings fully comparable, and must never swallow a concurrent material
 * move by triggering a re-baseline.
 *
 * The baseline is scoped to the wallet identity (the sampled addresses).
 * Importing a different wallet must never cross-compare the old wallet's
 * total against the new one's — an address change resets the baseline
 * cleanly, and the first read of the new wallet records its own baseline.
 *
 * Registered from the agent boot path (desktop/cloud only — mobile has no
 * EVM/Solana wallet surface, mirroring the /api/wallet route gate).
