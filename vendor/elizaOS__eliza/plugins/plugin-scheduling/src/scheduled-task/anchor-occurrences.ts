/**
 * Candidate occurrences of a `relative_to_anchor` trigger, shared by the due
 * evaluation and the `next_fire_at` index so both name the same instant.
 *
 * A wall-clock anchor (wake, bedtime, lunch) recurs once per owner-local day,
 * but `anchor + offsetMinutes` can land on a different local day than its
 * anchor: wake 21:00 + 240 is 01:00 the next day, wake 06:00 - 480 is 22:00
 * the day before. Resolving only today's anchor leaves such a task perpetually
 * pending or fires it a day off, so the anchor is resolved for every local day
 * whose occurrence can land on yesterday, today or tomorrow.
 *
 * Selection: the due occurrence is the latest one at or before `now` that lies
 * on the owner's current local day. Occurrences on an earlier local day are
 * never replayed, the staleness bound the single-day resolution implied, and
 * a `firedAt` at or after the occurrence marks it spent. A fixed-instant
 * anchor (a calendar event start) has one occurrence, not one per day; it
 * stays due until fired even after the day rolls over, so an occurrence the
 * runner missed across midnight still fires once. The index candidate is the
 * unfired due occurrence when there is one, else the earliest occurrence
 * after `now`.
 *
 * Registry anchors are asked about adjacent days through `AnchorContext.nowIso`
 * placed at the last instant of an earlier day or the first instant of a later
 * one; an observed anchor answers with that day's latest observation or null,
 * and the static owner-fact anchor fills the gap.
