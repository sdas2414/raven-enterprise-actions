# @elizaos/plugin-knowledge

HTTP API surface and reusable presentation components for the elizaOS document store.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-knowledge build  # build
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-knowledge test   # tests
```

The app renderer uses `src/browser.ts` for document views and registration;
runtime routes and document-service loading stay on the runtime entry.
