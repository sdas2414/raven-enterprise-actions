/**
 * Cross-platform e2e smoke test for plugin-computeruse.
 *
 * Boots the ComputerUseService against a minimal mock runtime, registers the
 * service, and drives a short action sequence:
 *   screenshot → mouse_move(coords) → type("hello") → screenshot
 *
 * Asserts on observable outcomes only (success flags + non-empty screenshot
 * buffers). No vi.mock, no monkey-patching of platform code — the actual
 * cross-platform driver runs.
 *
 * Skip rules:
 *   - Linux: skipped unless DISPLAY is set (CI must use Xvfb / xvfb-run)
 *   - Windows: runs when the selected driver and desktop session are available
 *   - macOS: runs normally (Accessibility/Screen Recording permissions are a
 *     prerequisite; if denied the assertion-level check is converted to skip).
 *
 * Driver:
 *   - Default uses ELIZA_COMPUTERUSE_DRIVER=nutjs (cross-platform native).
 *   - When the @nut-tree-fork/nut-js native module is unavailable (deps not
 *     installed yet, or unsupported arch), the test gracefully skips.
