# @elizaos/plugin-web-search

Uses an explicitly authorized Chromium profile for host web searches, with
credential-free Parallel search when no granted browser is available before dispatch.
Select **Use this browser** in the Browser panel to grant the current agent access
to that exact profile; **Stop using this browser** revokes it. Saved selection takes
precedence over `WEB_SEARCH_BROWSER_PROFILE_ID` and `WEB_SEARCH_BROWSER_TARGET_ID`.
A remote profile requires a separate owner grant; conversation relay permission
alone does not grant browser access.

The host uses `./browser-web-search`. It retains complete observed page text and
never replays a dispatched search through another provider after read failures,
consent pages, or human checks. The public edge action remains credential-free.
Provider failures return an explicit unavailable result.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-web-search build  # build
bun plugins/plugin-web-search/scripts/test-browser-search.mjs # real Linux Chromium + Google
```

The live browser check needs the built extension and `/usr/bin/chromium`. It uses
a disposable profile and records evidence in `test-results/browser-search/`. A
Google consent or human-check page is an explicit failure, not a passing search.
