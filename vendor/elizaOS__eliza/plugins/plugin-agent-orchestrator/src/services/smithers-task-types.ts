/**
 * Types for the durable Smithers-backed coding-task runner.
 *
 * A coding task is modelled as a durable Smithers workflow:
 *   provision → (durable loop of agent turns) → approval gate → submit → summarize
 *
 * Smithers owns scheduling + durable per-step/per-iteration SQLite state (so a
 * crashed agent resumes from the last completed turn). The actual work of each
 * step is delegated back to the host through a {@link TaskStepExecutor}; the
 * runner never drives a coding agent itself — it drives the *control plane* and
 * calls the executor, which in production is backed by the ACP services.
