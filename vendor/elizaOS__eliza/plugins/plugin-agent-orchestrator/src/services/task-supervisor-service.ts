/**
 * TaskSupervisorService — the multi-task "juggler" (#8900, EPIC #8885).
 *
 * The orchestrator stores N tasks but nothing proactively tells the user how
 * they're all doing — on Telegram (no side tabs) the user has to keep asking.
 * This service ticks on an interval, scans the in-flight tasks per originating
 * room, and posts a compact status digest back to that room — but only when the
 * digest CHANGED since the last post, so a steady state never spams the chat.
 *
 * The tick logic is a pure function (`runSupervisorTick`) over injected views so
 * it unit-tests without timers, services, or a runtime.
 *
 * Damping, layered on the change-driven dedup: a task younger than one tick
 * interval is not digested yet (a sub-interval inline build finishes before a
 * digest could say anything its completion relay won't say better), a room
 * whose task just relayed a completion is suppressed for that tick (the digest
 * must not be a second uncoordinated message about the same event), and a task
 * held un-done by a verification gate after reporting completion digests on
 * status transitions only. See noteTaskCompletion for the cross-surface half.
 *
 * Stall handling is OWNER-scoped, never room-scoped: a task's idle/stalled
 * age is deliberately NOT part of the digest, because folding an incrementing
 * idle timer into the room post turns a single stuck task into a stream of
 * unprompted "still stalled" messages in a shared channel (completions already
 * relay; a mere stall is noise there). A task that crosses the STALLED band
 * instead escalates once through `runtime.reportError`, which feeds the
 * RECENT_ERRORS ring and the owner-escalation threshold — quiet, owner-facing,
 * and deduplicated until the task recovers.
