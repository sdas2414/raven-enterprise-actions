/**
 * Completion-evidence assembly for the auto goal-verifier.
 *
 * The auto goal-verifier ("grill until truly done") historically judged a
 * completed sub-agent task against its acceptance criteria using only the thin
 * `task_complete` event-summary string. That makes it trivially foolable: a
 * sub-agent that *claims* success but pasted no proof reads identically to one
 * that actually shipped.
 *
 * This module turns the rich signals the orchestrator ALREADY has into a single
 * clearly-SECTIONED evidence string the verifier can grill against:
 *
 *   - **CHANGESET** — the real git diffstat + changed files + a capped diff,
 *     captured from git at `task_complete` (same {@link WorkspaceChangeSet} the
 *     CODING_SESSION_CHANGES provider renders), so "I changed X" is checkable.
 *   - **DELIVERABLE** — the sub-agent's captured deliverable (printed/tool
 *     output the router extracted) and its final reply text.
 *   - **VERIFIED URLS** — URLs the router probed at completion, flagged
 *     loopback-vs-public so the verifier can reject localhost-only "deploys".
 *   - **TEST / BUILD / TYPECHECK OUTPUT** — lines mined from the session's
 *     recorded events/messages that look like build/test/typecheck output, so a
 *     real green run is distinguishable from a bare claim.
 *   - **ARTIFACTS** — references to screenshot/trajectory artifacts found on the
 *     task/session, so UI and agent-behavior criteria have something to cite.
 *
 * Pure (no IO): the caller gathers the inputs (durable store + live ACP session
 * metadata) and hands them in. The whole assembly is null-safe and size-capped
 * so it can be fed straight into the verifier without blowing the prompt
 * budget.
 *
