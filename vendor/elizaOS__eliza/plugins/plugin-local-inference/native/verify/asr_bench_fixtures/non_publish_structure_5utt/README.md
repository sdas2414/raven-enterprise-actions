# ASR Bench Non-Publish Structure Fixture

This directory is a deterministic corpus-shape fixture for the ASR WER workflow.
The WAV files are short generated tones, not speech and not TTS. They only prove
that five WAV+.txt pairs can be carried through scripts without downloading
models.

Do not use this directory as publish evidence. The 2b ASR WER publish gate
requires at least five explicit real microphone or field recordings with matching
transcripts, run through:

```sh
bun plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/verify/asr_bench.ts \
  --bundle ~/.eliza/local-inference/models/eliza-1-2b.bundle \
  --wav-dir <real-recorded-wav-txt-dir> \
  --real-recorded \
  --min-real-recorded-utterances 5
```
