/* polar_qjl.c - deterministic per-block +/-1 sign vector for the QJL
 * residual correction.
 *
 * NOTE on parity with polar_quant.py:
 *   The Python reference uses torch.randint(0, 2, (block_size,),
 *   generator=Generator(seed=42)) and remaps {0,1} -> {-1,+1}.  That
 *   sequence depends on torch internals and is not portable across
 *   torch versions.  We deliberately do *not* try to mirror it here.
 *
 *   Instead, this file generates a deterministic xorshift32 stream
 *   that both the C encoder and C decoder agree on, and the GGUF
 *   converter is responsible for either:
 *     (a) regenerating QJL sign bits to match this xorshift32 stream
 *         so the on-device decoder sees a consistent +/-1 vector, OR
 *     (b) writing the sign vector explicitly into GGUF metadata
 *         alongside the codes.
 *
 *   The roundtrip unit test exercises path (a) implicitly: encoder and
 *   decoder both call polar_qjl_signs(), so the residual correction
 *   cancels out on a noise-free input regardless of which sequence we
 *   pick, as long as both sides agree.
