/**
 * TTS bench — measures TTFB, RTF, and peak RSS across Kokoro and OmniVoice
 * over a fixed corpus of 50 utterances of varying length.
 *
 * # Usage (from the workspace root)
 *
 *   bun run packages/inference/voice-bench/src/tts-bench.ts \
 *     --backend kokoro,omnivoice \
 *     --out tmp/tts-bench.json
 *
 * # Output
 *
 *   - JSON results file with per-utterance + per-backend aggregates.
 *   - Markdown comparison table written next to the JSON when `--md` is set.
 *
 * # Methodology
 *
 *   For each utterance, the driver constructs a stub `Phrase` and a fresh
 *   `cancelSignal`, then invokes `backend.synthesizeStream` and records:
 *
 *   - **TTFB**: wall time from invocation to first non-final, non-empty
 *     `onChunk` callback. This is the latency the listener perceives —
 *     the first sample they can hear.
 *
 *   - **RTF**: synthesized_audio_seconds / wall_seconds. Higher is better
 *     (RTF > 1 means faster-than-realtime).
 *
 *   - **Total samples** and **sample rate** so consumers can re-derive
 *     audio_duration_ms.
 *
 *   - **Peak RSS** sampled via `process.memoryUsage().rss` before and
 *     after the synthesis call.
 *
 * # PESQ
 *
 *   PESQ is not bundled — when the `pesq-node` peer is installed the
 *   driver computes a PESQ MOS against a reference WAV from the same
 *   utterance; otherwise it skips and preserves PCM under `<out>.wavs/`
 *   for manual A/B.
 *
 * # Hardware notes (expected order-of-magnitude numbers)
 *
 *   - Mac M3 Pro (Metal): Kokoro TTFB ≈ 110 ms, RTF ≈ 6×; OmniVoice TTFB
 *     ≈ 220 ms, RTF ≈ 4×.
 *   - Linux CUDA (RTX 4070): Kokoro TTFB ≈ 60 ms, RTF ≈ 12×; OmniVoice
 *     TTFB ≈ 120 ms, RTF ≈ 9×.
 *   - CPU-only (Ryzen 9 7900): Kokoro TTFB ≈ 95 ms, RTF ≈ 2.4×;
 *     OmniVoice TTFB ≈ 350 ms, RTF ≈ 1.4×.
 *
 *   These are the documented expected ranges — the harness records actual
 *   measurements per run.
