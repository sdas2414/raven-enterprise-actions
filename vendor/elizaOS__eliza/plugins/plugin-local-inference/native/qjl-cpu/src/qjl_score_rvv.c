/*
 * RISC-V Vector (RVV 1.0) GQA attention-score kernel (fp32 sketch).
 *
 * Algorithm shape matches qjl_score_ref.c and qjl_score_neon.c:
 *
 *   score[h_q, t] = ||k_t|| * sqrt(pi/2)/proj_dim *
 *                   sum_j (2 * bit_packed[t, j] - 1) * q_sketch[h_q, j]
 *
 * Implementation strategy:
 *
 * The "obvious" approach (NEON-style) is to expand each byte of the
 * packed signs into 8 fp32 +/-1 lanes, FMA against the matching 8 fp32
 * lanes of q_sketch, accumulate, reduce. That works but on RVV the bit
 * expansion is awkward — there is no direct "load 8 bits into 8 lanes
 * of +/-1" primitive.
 *
 * A cleaner RVV idiom: load the 256-bit sign vector once into a mask
 * register via __riscv_vlm_v_b8 (mask load from memory, LSB-first byte
 * layout — exactly the QJL packed-bit layout), then for each strip of
 * the q_sketch use vfneg under the inverted mask to flip the sign of
 * lanes whose bit is 0. That gives us a vector of signed q values to
 * FMA against an accumulator, in one mask-merge instruction per strip.
 *
 * vfneg has a tail-undisturbed / mask-undisturbed semantics; we use
 * __riscv_vfneg_v_f32m8_m to negate only the masked-off (bit=0) lanes
 * and leave the bit=1 lanes intact. Since the mask register holds
 * proj_dim=256 bits and we strip across the same axis, the mask slice
 * for the current strip is auto-selected by vl.
 *
 * LMUL m8 is used here for f32 to maximize throughput on wide-VLEN
 * implementations: on VLEN=2048 this is 64 fp32 lanes per strip,
 * covering proj_dim=256 in 4 strips. m8 leaves no spare LMUL groups
 * for the accumulator since v0 is the mask — that's fine, we keep
 * the mask in v0 and the accumulator in a m8 register group.
 *
 * Reduction across strips: per (h_q, t) we maintain one m1 partial
 * sum, accumulated via __riscv_vfredusum_vs_f32m8_f32m1 outside the
 * strip loop (or, to keep the inner loop tight, accumulate in m8 and
 * reduce once at the end — see the implementation below).
 *
 * Reduction order vs scalar: RVV's vfredusum has implementation-defined
 * intermediate ordering (tree-shaped on most hardware), so the result
 * is not bit-identical to the scalar left-to-right sum. The error is
 * bounded by ~ULP * proj_dim and we test against a 1e-4 absolute
 * tolerance (same as the AVX2 path — see qjl_bench --parity).
