/*
 * wakeword-cpp — public C ABI for the standalone native plugin that
 * ports the openWakeWord (Apache-2.0, https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord)
 * three-stage streaming pipeline (melspectrogram → embedding → classifier
 * head) off `onnxruntime-node` and onto the elizaOS/llama.cpp ggml
 * dispatcher.
 *
 * The TypeScript reference implementation that this library is replacing
 * lives at:
 *   plugins/plugin-local-inference/src/services/voice/wake-word.ts
 *
 * That file is read-only for this port — it documents the contract.
 *
 * Three GGUFs are loaded per session, mirroring openWakeWord's three
 * ONNX graphs:
 *   1. melspec   — 16 kHz PCM → log-mel frames. Pure C; no ggml weights.
 *   2. embedding — small CNN over a sliding mel window → 96-dim embedding.
 *   3. classifier — small MLP over a 16-embedding window → P(wake) ∈ [0,1].
 *
 * Streaming contract (the only mode this header exposes):
 *   - The caller drips 16 kHz mono float PCM into `wakeword_process`.
 *   - The library buffers internally and runs the three stages on its own
 *     hop schedule.
 *   - On every call, `*score_out` is the most recent classifier
 *     probability. Early calls (before enough mel + embedding context has
 *     accumulated) return 0.
 *
 * Threading: reentrant against distinct `wakeword_handle` values. Sharing
 * one handle across threads is the caller's mutex problem.
 *
 * Error handling: every entry point returns `int` — zero on success,
 * negative `errno`-style codes on failure.
 *
 * No silent fallbacks. A missing GGUF, a bad shape, or a corrupt graph
 * surfaces as a structured error, never as a "best effort 0.0".
