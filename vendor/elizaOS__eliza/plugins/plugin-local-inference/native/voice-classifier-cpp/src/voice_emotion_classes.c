/*
 * voice-classifier-cpp — emotion class-name table.
 *
 * The 7-class basic-emotion vocabulary is a *contract* shared by:
 *
 *   - the GGUF conversion script (`packages/scripts/plugins/plugin-local-inference/native/voice-classifier-cpp/voice_emotion_to_gguf.py`),
 *     which must pack head logits in this exact order;
 *   - the runtime decode in the (eventual) real emotion TU, which reads
 *     the GGUF logits in this order without any remap;
 *   - the TS binding (`voice-emotion-classifier-ggml.ts`), which surfaces
 *     these names to callers verbatim.
 *
 * Class order is locked at:
 *
 *   0 = neutral
 *   1 = happy
 *   2 = sad
 *   3 = angry
 *   4 = fear
 *   5 = disgust
 *   6 = surprise
 *
 * Anything depending on this order needs to be updated together with
 * this file. The test in `test/voice_emotion_classes_test.c` enforces
 * the order so a silent reorder fails CI.
