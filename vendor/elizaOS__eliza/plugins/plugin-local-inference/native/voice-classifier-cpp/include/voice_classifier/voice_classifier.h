/*
 * voice-classifier-cpp — public C ABI for the standalone native plugin
 * that ports three small voice-side classifiers to the elizaOS/llama.cpp
 * fork's ggml dispatcher, replacing onnxruntime-node:
 *
 *   1. Voice emotion classifier — returns soft probabilities over a
 *      fixed 7-class basic-emotion set (neutral, happy, sad, angry,
 *      fear, disgust, surprise). Suggested upstreams to convert: an
 *      ECAPA / wav2vec2-based emotion head such as
 *      `harshit345/xlsr-wav2vec-speech-emotion-recognition` (CC-BY-NC) or
 *      `audeering/wav2vec2-large-robust-12-ft-emotion-msp-dim` (with
 *      teacher distillation to a small student); the GGUF schema is
 *      pinned at conversion time.
 *
 *   2. End-of-turn (EOT) detector — binary turn-completion classifier
 *      operating on a short audio window (NOT on text). Suggested
 *      upstreams: `livekit/turn-detector` audio variants or
 *      `pipecat-ai/turn`. Output is a single P(end_of_turn) ∈ [0, 1].
 *
 *   3. Speaker embedding encoder — emits a 256-dim WeSpeaker
 *      ResNet34-LM style speaker embedding suitable for cosine-distance
 *      matching. The output dim is fixed at 256 (matches the upstream
 *      `wenet-e2e/wespeaker` ResNet34-LM checkpoint trained on
 *      VoxCeleb2-dev with the Large-Margin fine-tune). Conversion
 *      scripts that target a different embedding width must reproject
 *      before packing the GGUF.
 *
 * All three heads share:
 *
 *   - **Audio convention.** Input is mono, 32-bit float (`float`),
 *     samples in `[-1, 1]`, sample rate fixed at 16 kHz. Callers running
 *     at a different rate must pre-resample (the sibling `silero-vad`
 *     library exposes `silero_vad_resample_linear` for that).
 *
 *   - **Mel front-end.** Each head consumes a log-mel spectrogram
 *     (n_mels=80, n_fft=512, hop=160) computed by the shared
 *     `voice_mel_compute` helper in `src/voice_mel_features.c`. The mel
 *     extractor is part of this library, not the model graph, so the
 *     three heads agree on framing and the GGUF only carries the model
 *     weights.
 *
 *   - **Error handling.** All entry points return `int`: zero on
 *     success, negative `errno`-style codes on failure (`-ENOSYS` for
 *     unavailable forward graphs, `-ENOENT` for missing GGUF, `-EINVAL` for shape /
 *     argument mismatch, `-ENOMEM` for allocation failures). On any
 *     non-zero return the function clears its out-parameters so the
 *     caller cannot accidentally read uninitialized memory.
 *
 *   - **Threading.** Reentrant against distinct handles. Sharing one
 *     handle across threads is the caller's mutex problem.
 *
 * The emotion, speaker, and diarizer heads now have scalar C forward
 * implementations behind the same ABI. The audio EOT head intentionally
 * returns `-ENOSYS` from `voice_eot_score` until an upstream audio-turn
 * model is pinned and converted. The class names, the cosine-distance
 * helper, and the mel extractor are real implementations and are used by
 * the test suite today.
