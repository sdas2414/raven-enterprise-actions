/**
 * Plugin-route registration for the voice-profile HTTP surface (issue #8234).
 *
 * `handleVoiceSpeakerProfileRoutes` (bind/unbind a recognized voice to an
 * elizaOS entity) and `handleVoiceProfilesManagementRoutes` (the server half
 * of the `VoiceProfileSection` management UI) are prefix dispatchers, but the
 * only server mount of `handleLocalInferenceRoutes` is gated behind
 * `/api/local-inference*` path prefixes — so neither the `/v1/voice/
 * speaker-profiles` nor the `/api/voice/profiles` namespace was reachable
 * over HTTP. Registering them as `rawPath` routes on the plugin object puts
 * them on `runtime.routes`, which both the upstream agent server and the
 * app dashboard server dispatch.
 *
 * Every route is private: the host dispatcher answers 401 for
 * unauthenticated callers before the handler runs.
