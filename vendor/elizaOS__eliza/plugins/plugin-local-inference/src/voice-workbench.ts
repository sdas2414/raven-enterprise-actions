/**
 * Public Voice Workbench surface (#8785).
 *
 * The framework-level pieces other packages consume (the scenario-runner's
 * `voice` turn kind, headful players, CI entrypoints): the scenario schema, the
 * corpus generator, the headless runner + services contract, the shared scorers
 * (via `e2e-harness`), the benchmark report, and the run entrypoint. Kept as a
 * thin re-export barrel so consumers import one stable subpath
 * (`@elizaos/plugin-local-inference/voice-workbench`) instead of deep paths.
