/**
 * Live device signals for the capability-driven `auto` routing policy.
 *
 * `classifyDeviceTier()` is a *static* assessment — it scores the hardware once
 * and caches the result. But a device that classifies MAX/GOOD at session start
 * can still become a poor place to run local inference *right now*: a sustained
 * workload pushes the SoC into thermal throttling, or decode throughput collapses
 * under memory pressure. Those are live, time-varying signals the static tier
 * cannot see.
 *
 * This module exposes the two live signals the `auto` branch demotes on:
 *
 *   - **thermal state** — read from the device bridge's most recent device
 *     capabilities (`nominal | fair | serious | critical | unknown`). `serious`
 *     or `critical` means the OS is actively throttling clocks; forcing local
 *     inference there makes turns slower than cloud and worsens the throttle.
 *   - **decode throughput** — the recent p50 decode tokens/sec from
 *     `inferenceTelemetry`. When it falls below a usable budget the on-device
 *     path is no longer competitive and `auto` routes to cloud.
 *
 * Both signals are *optional*: a quantity the host could not measure is reported
 * as `null` (never a fabricated `0`), and a `null` signal never demotes — the
 * static tier decision stands. The default source reads the real subsystems; a
 * test or alternate host can inject its own via `setLiveDeviceSignalsSource`.
