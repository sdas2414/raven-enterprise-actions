/**
 * Voice checkpoint policy — thin VAD-event → checkpoint-op translator that
 * sits between the voice loop (turn-controller / pipeline / vad) and the
 * `GatedCheckpointManager` (`../checkpoint-manager.ts`).
 *
 * Why a separate policy module?
 *
 *   - The constraint envelope on this scaffold explicitly forbids editing
 *     `turn-controller.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `pipeline-impls.ts`, `vad.ts`,
 *     `scheduler.ts`, `phrase-chunker.ts`, `barge-in.ts`, `transcriber.ts`,
 *     and anything under `voice/kokoro/` / `voice/streaming-asr/`. Those
 *     files are owned by other agents.
 *   - But the upstream merge for `--ctx-checkpoints` lands "any week now,"
 *     and the JS-side rollback policy is what the merge unlocks. So the
 *     policy lives here as a free-standing module that the turn controller
 *     can pick up in a follow-up PR by injecting it into its VAD handler
 *     and calling `onSpeechPause` / `onSpeechResume` / `onSpeechEndCommit`
 *     / `onHardStop` at the matching transitions.
 *   - The wiring required in `turn-controller.ts` is documented in the
 *     `WIRING-INSTRUCTIONS` comment at the bottom of this file and in
 *     `docs/eliza-1-ctx-checkpoints-integration.md`. We intentionally do
 *     NOT apply the wiring here — that is a follow-up PR scoped to the
 *     turn-controller owner.
 *
 * Policy summary (one C1 per turn, named `pre-speculative-T<turnId>`):
 *
 *   - `onSpeechPause(turnId)` — VAD reports the user stopped speaking but
 *     hangover hasn't elapsed. Save C1 and let the caller kick the
 *     speculative drafter. If the save fails the policy logs and continues
 *     (callers MUST treat speculative work as best-effort).
 *
 *   - `onSpeechResume(turnId)` — VAD fires `speech-active` within the
 *     rollback window. If we previously kicked a speculative draft (the
 *     caller flips `speculativeFired=true` to tell us), restore C1 so the
 *     KV state is rolled back to the pre-draft point. Otherwise no-op.
 *
 *   - `onSpeechEndCommit(turnId)` — VAD's hangover elapsed; the pause was a
 *     real turn boundary. The speculative draft is promoted. Erase C1: we
 *     no longer need a rollback target for this turn.
 *
 *   - `onHardStop(turnId)` — caller-initiated cancellation (e.g. user
 *     pressed mute, app backgrounded). If C1 exists, prefer restoring to
 *     it so the KV cache is in a known-clean state for the next turn; if
 *     C1 isn't around, fall back to `cancel` (the gated manager will
 *     either issue `DELETE /slots/<id>` or invoke the SSE-disconnect
 *     callback depending on the gate).
 *
 * All four hooks are idempotent and survive a missing C1 by no-op'ing.
 * Errors from the underlying manager are caught and reported through the
 * `events.onError` sink — the policy NEVER throws back into the voice
 * loop, because a failing checkpoint endpoint must not be able to break
 * audio.
 *
 * The policy holds no state of its own beyond the per-turn name; the
 * `GatedCheckpointManager` owns the registry, the REST client, and the
 * capability cache.
 *
 * --- WIRING-INSTRUCTIONS (turn-controller.ts) -----------------------------
 *
 * The turn-controller owner adds (after the upstream merge lands):
 *
 *   1. Construct a `GatedCheckpointManager` once at session start and
 *      pass it into a `CheckpointPolicy` instance (one per slot).
 *   2. In the VAD `speech-pause` handler, immediately after the pause
 *      hangover timer is armed:
 *
 *          await policy.onSpeechPause(this.turnId, this.slotId);
 *          // ...kick speculative drafter against the partial transcript
 *
 *   3. In the VAD `speech-active` handler (only when arriving within the
 *      rollback window — the controller already tracks this):
 *
 *          await policy.onSpeechResume(this.turnId, this.slotId, {
 *            speculativeFired: this.speculativeFired,
 *          });
 *          // ...abort the speculative drafter
 *
 *   4. In the `speech-end` → SPEAKING transition (after the verifier
 *      promotes the draft):
 *
 *          await policy.onSpeechEndCommit(this.turnId, this.slotId);
 *
 *   5. In the `dispose()` path and any other hard-stop site (mute, app
 *      background, error shutdown, barge-in mid-SPEAKING):
 *
 *          await policy.onHardStop(this.turnId, this.slotId, () => {
 *            this.speculativeAbort?.abort();  // SSE-disconnect callback
 *          });
 *
 *   6. Feature flag: pass `useCtxCheckpoints` through to the
 *      `GatedCheckpointManager` constructor; when off the policy still
 *      runs but every call is a logged no-op.
 *
 * The turn-controller must NOT call `mgr.save/restore/erase/cancel`
 * directly — those names are reserved for the policy so the gated/no-op
 * branching stays in one place. The `policy.events.onError` sink lets the
 * controller forward checkpoint failures into its existing voice-loop
 * telemetry without coupling to the REST error type.
