/**
 * Prefix-preserving TTS rollback queue for barge-in handling.
 *
 * When the user barges in mid-response, the naive approach drops ALL
 * in-flight audio chunks. This queue does better: it tags each audio
 * chunk with the token range it covers, and on barge-in retains chunks
 * whose token range ends at or before the divergence point (the last
 * committed token index when the barge-in fires).
 *
 * If the new user utterance continues the topic, audio up to the
 * divergence point plays smoothly. Chunks for tokens past the divergence
 * are dropped.
 *
 * Data model:
 *
 *   TaggedAudioChunk — a PCM buffer paired with [start, end] token indices
 *     (inclusive) and its duration in milliseconds.
 *
 *   PrefixPreservingQueue — ordered queue of TaggedAudioChunk. On barge-in
 *     with a given divergencePoint:
 *       keep   when chunk.tokenRange[1] <= divergencePoint
 *       drop   when chunk.tokenRange[0] >  divergencePoint
 *       trim   when chunk straddles the point (tokenRange[0] <= point
 *              but tokenRange[1] > point) — kept whole; the scheduler
 *              treats sub-phrase granularity as a best-effort approximation.
 *
 * The old `handleBargeIn` path (ring-buffer drain + full stop) remains
 * active as a fallback when the queue is not wired (e.g. the backend
 * emits chunks without token-range tags). When the queue IS wired, the
 * scheduler calls `rollbackAt(divergencePoint)` instead of a plain drain,
 * and replays the retained prefix into the sink before resuming.
