/**
 * Phoneme streaming for Kokoro-82M.
 *
 * Kokoro consumes a sequence of phoneme ids (espeak-ng IPA tokenised against a
 * small fixed vocab). The scheduler emits phrases at punctuation or
 * `phoneme-stream` boundaries (see `voice/phrase-chunker.ts` `chunkOn`
 * option). This module is the seam between those phrase boundaries and the
 * model's input tensor:
 *
 *   text → phonemizer.phonemize() → KokoroPhonemeSequence (ids) → runtime
 *
 * For maximum responsiveness the runtime can call `streamPhonemes()` against
 * an async text iterator (chunked draft tokens) and forward each window of
 * accumulated ids as soon as a phoneme boundary fires. The default `flushAt`
 * is one phoneme — i.e. emit progress per id — but production deployments
 * lift this to ~8 phonemes to amortise the ONNX forward pass on small
 * windows. This file intentionally has no dependency on the rest of the
 * voice scaffold so it can be reused by the fine-tune evaluator script.
 */
