/**
 * Kokoro-82M voice catalog.
 *
 * Re-exports the bundled `KOKORO_VOICE_PACKS` table from `voice-presets.ts`
 * under the canonical filename the integration spec calls out, and adds a few
 * search helpers used by the runtime-selection layer and the picker UI.
 *
 * Each voice pack ships as a small (~256 fp32 values × 4 bytes ≈ 1 KB) style
 * tensor under `<modelRoot>/voices/<file>`. Adding voices is cheap (download
 * a single .bin), and a hot ONNX session can swap voices per-utterance with
 * no re-init cost — the model is the same.
 *
 * Upstream registry: https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/tree/main/voices
