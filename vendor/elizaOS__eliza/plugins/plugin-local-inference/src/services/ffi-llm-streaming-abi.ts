/**
 * TypeScript-side ABI surface for the in-process FFI streaming LLM path.
 *
 * This file mirrors the C header at
 * `packages/inference/llama.cpp/omnivoice/src/ffi-streaming.h` — the
 * function names are the same so that bun:ffi symbol resolution uses the
 * exact C exports without any aliasing.
 *
 * Rationale for a separate ABI module
 * ────────────────────────────────────
 * `ffi-streaming-runner.ts` depends on the `ElizaInferenceFfi` handle from
 * `voice/ffi-bindings.ts`, which in turn is tied to the omnivoice-fused
 * build of `libelizainference`. That handle carries TTS, ASR, embedding,
 * and streaming-LLM symbols together. The ABI declared here is the
 * *streaming-LLM-only* slice that the mobile bootstrap needs to reason
 * about independently — it does not assume the full fused binary is
 * loaded. Callers that already have an `ElizaInferenceFfi` can implement
 * `FfiLlmStreamingAbi` as a thin wrapper; callers that only have the
 * llama.cpp-only `libelizainference.so` (e.g. the Android AOSP bootstrap
 * before omnivoice ships) can implement it directly.
 *
 * MTP phasing
 * ──────────────
 * Phase 1 — target model only. The `FfiLlmStreamingAbi` alone is
 * sufficient: open a single-model streaming session, prefill, generate,
 * cancel, close. No drafter weights required.
 *
 * Phase 2 — speculative decoding. When `MobileInferenceCapabilities.
 * mtpSupported` is `true`, swap to `FfiMtpStreamingAbi` which opens
 * a paired drafter + verifier session and runs the speculative decode loop
 * on-device. The two ABI surfaces share the same `FfiLlmHandle` brand so
 * the dispatcher (`runtime-dispatcher.ts`) sees a uniform handle type.
 *
 * iOS XCFramework gap
 * ───────────────────
 * The ABI is defined here, the C header is frozen, but the iOS
 * XCFramework that re-exports these symbols through the Swift bridge has
 * not shipped yet. `loadIosStreamingLlmBinding()` in
 * `ios-llama-streaming.ts` returns `null` until the XCFramework build
 * lands. See `docs/inference/ffi-streaming.md` §iOS XCFramework gap for
 * the current status.
