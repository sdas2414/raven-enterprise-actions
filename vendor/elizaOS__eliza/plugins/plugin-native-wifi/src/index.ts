/**
 * Public entry for @elizaos/plugin-native-wifi — Android-only Wi-Fi overlay.
 *
 * Wraps `@elizaos/plugin-native-wifi/bridge` and exposes a simple scan + connect UI plus
 * a single SCAN_WIFI agent action. The app is only registered on Android via
 * the `register` subpath; other platforms intentionally leave registration unchanged so
 * the app does not appear in the catalog where it cannot function.
