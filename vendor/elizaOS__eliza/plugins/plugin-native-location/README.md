# @elizaos/capacitor-location

A Capacitor plugin that provides geolocation services (current position, watch position,
permissions) to Eliza agents running in browser, Electrobun desktop, iOS, and Android
environments.

See [bridge definitions](src/definitions.ts) for the native API. Native targets require their SDKs, registered bridge, and OS permissions.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd plugins/plugin-native-location build  # build
```

Android uses framework `LocationManager` providers without requiring Google Play
Services. Pending fixes and watches are cancelled on teardown, and cached ages
use the monotonic clock. The emulator suite injects known coordinates and checks
reads, watch cancellation, and timeouts without silently skipping missing fixes:

```bash
node packages/app/scripts/android-native-plugins.ts --serial emulator-5554 --plugin plugin-native-location
```
