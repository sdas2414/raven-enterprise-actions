/**
 * Local-inference runtime-class discriminator.
 *
 * The local stack is Eliza-1 only: every text model is an Eliza-1 bundle served
 * by the fused `libelizainference` (`desktop-fused-ffi-backend-runtime.ts`). The
 * fused context is anchored at a *bundle root* (`ffi.create(bundleRoot)` →
 * `<bundleRoot>/text/*.gguf`) and the full optimization stack rides along:
 * embedded draft head speculative decoding, stock q8_0 KV cache, native
 * tokenization over the resident Gemma 4 (eliza-1) vocab, and fused
 * voice/vision. It cannot load an arbitrary single GGUF — the vocab and the KV
 * cache layout are tokenizer/format-specific to Eliza-1.
 *
 * The discriminator is retained as a single-valued type so external importers
 * keep resolving; there is no longer a second runtime class to branch on.
