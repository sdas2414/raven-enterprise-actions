/**
 * Public entry for @elizaos/plugin-native-phone.
 *
 * Two surfaces ship in this package:
 *  - The dialer + recent-calls surface, authored once as the unified `phone`
 *    plugin view (PhoneView → PhoneSpatialView), backed by
 *    `@elizaos/plugin-native-phone/bridge`.
 *  - The Phone Companion — Capacitor pairing + chat-mirror + remote-session
 *    surface that runs alongside (or in place of) the desktop UI.
 *
 * Both surfaces are exported from the package barrel; its `PhoneView` is the
 * raw embeddable dialer. Hosts that own page navigation load the framed
 * `PhonePage` through the `/ui`, signed-registration, or view-bundle ABI.
