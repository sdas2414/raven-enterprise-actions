/*
 * docTR (Document Text Recognition) — public C ABI for the standalone
 * native plugin that ports mindee/doctr's detection + recognition heads
 * to the elizaOS/llama.cpp ggml dispatcher.
 *
 * Upstream:
 *   https://github.com/mindee/doctr
 *
 * This header is the interface implemented by the native CPU reference
 * runtime. Dispatcher-backed builds must preserve the same ABI.
 *
 * Two heads are exposed:
 *   1. db_resnet50 — differentiable-binarization text detection. Input
 *      is an RGB image plane; output is a list of axis-aligned bboxes
 *      in pixel coordinates plus a confidence per bbox.
 *   2. crnn_vgg16_bn — CRNN word recognition. Input is a cropped word
 *      image (32-row normalized); output is a UTF-8 transcription plus
 *      a per-character confidence vector.
 *
 * Coordinate convention: every bbox is `{x, y, width, height}` in
 * source-image absolute pixel coordinates. The detector reports tile-
 * relative coordinates; the caller (plugin-vision's
 * `RapidOcrCoordAdapter` replacement) shifts them into the source
 * display's coordinate space.
 *
 * Threading: every entry point is reentrant against distinct
 * `doctr_session` handles. Sharing one handle across threads requires
 * the caller's own mutex.
 *
 * Error handling: all entry points return `int` — zero on success,
 * negative `errno`-style codes on failure.
