/**
 * `CircadianInsightContract` — runtime-registered seam between
 * `app-lifeops` (and other consumers) and the plugin-health circadian +
 * sleep-inference internals.
 *
 * W3-C drift D-4: prior to this contract, `app-lifeops/src/lifeops/
 * schedule-insight.ts` and downstream actions reached directly into
 * `@elizaos/plugin-health/src/sleep/*` for circadian scoring, awake
 * probability, sleep-cycle resolution, regularity scoring, and historical
 * episode reads. Per `post-cleanup-architecture.md` the sleep / circadian
 * / screen-time domain is owned by `plugin-health`. Consumers now read
 * through the contract registered on the runtime; the concrete
 * implementation continues to live inside `plugin-health` (where the
 * domain helpers live), so deep imports stay private to the plugin.
 *
 * The contract is read-only — the only writer of fresh inference is the
 * scheduler tick wired through `LifeOpsService.inspectSchedule`. Consumers
 * that just want "what does the scheduler currently believe" should call
 * `getCurrentSleepWindow` / `inferOptimalSchedulingWindow` instead of
 * driving fresh inspection themselves.
