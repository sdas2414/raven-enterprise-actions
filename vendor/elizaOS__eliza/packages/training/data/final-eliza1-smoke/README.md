# Eliza-1 synthetic smoke corpus

This is a tiny, deterministic fixture for exercising the corpus formatter and the end-to-end SFT pipeline.

This directory is part of `packages/training`.

Use a Python environment matching `pyproject.toml` and install the required dependencies.

No standalone wheel build is configured; run the Python sources directly.

Test from `packages/training`:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
