# fused_turboquant vendor notice

This directory vendors the upstream `fused-turboquant` package so we can
patch it in-place for Eliza-1 training experiments while preserving the
old Qwen3.5 gated-attention compatibility work for legacy reproduction.

## Modifications

Per Apache 2.0 §4(b), the changes made on top of upstream `0.1.0` are:

* **Internal imports rewritten from `fused_turboquant.X` to
  `eliza_training.quantization.fused_turboquant_vendored.X`** across every `.py` file in
  this tree (`__init__.py`, `core/*`, `hf/*`, `kernels/*`, `cache/*`,
  `benchmark/*`, `vllm_plugin/*`). This makes the package self-contained
  inside the workspace's `scripts/` directory; callers reach it as
  `from eliza_training.quantization.fused_turboquant_vendored.hf import patch_model`
  through the installed namespace. No behavioral change.

* **`hf/fused_cache.py` — gated-attention support.** The upstream
  `make_fused_attention_forward` assumes a vanilla `q_proj` of shape
  `num_heads * head_dim`. The retired Qwen3.5 line used a gated variant:
  `q_proj.out_features == 2 * num_heads * head_dim` (chunked along the
  last dim into `(query, gate)`) and the post-attention output is
  multiplied by `sigmoid(gate)` before `o_proj`. Three changes:

    1. New helper `_detect_attn_output_gate(module, config)` — returns
       True iff the attention module is the gated variant. Uses
       `config.attn_output_gate` when present, otherwise falls back to
       a `q_proj.out_features` shape probe (`== 2 * n_heads * head_dim`).
    2. `_probe_attention_module` now returns `attn_output_gate` so
       downstream callers can branch. `make_fused_attention_forward`
       reads it and:
         - Uses the config's `num_attention_heads` directly when
           computing `n_heads` (since `q_proj.out_features // head_dim`
           overcounts by 2x on gated modules).
         - When gated: chunks `q_proj(hidden_states)` along the last
           dim of a `(B, T, n_heads, 2*head_dim)` view into
           `(query, gate)`, runs the existing fused path on `query`
           only, then multiplies the post-attention output by
           `sigmoid(gate)` (reshaped to `(B, T, n_heads*head_dim)`)
           before `o_proj`.
         - When non-gated: behavior unchanged.
    3. The Gemma cutover narrowed `KNOWN_COMPATIBLE` back to the
       Gemma-era decoder families endorsed by the training wrappers.
       The gated branch remains in code for explicit legacy reproduction,
       but the retired Qwen3.5 classes are no longer advertised as
       known-compatible release targets.

  The K/V projection paths are untouched — gating affects only Q in the
  retired Qwen3.5 layout, and `cache.store_compressed_key` /
  `cache.store_compressed_value` operate on K/V which retain their
  vanilla `(B, T, n_kv_heads * head_dim)` shape.

* **`hf/fused_cache.py` — partial-rotary RoPE.** The retired Qwen3.5 line uses partial
  rotary embeddings (only the first `cos.shape[-1]` coordinates of each
  head are rotated, the rest pass through). The upstream
  `_apply_rotary_pos_emb` assumed full-head RoPE and crashed with a
  shape mismatch on that layout (`rotary_dim=64` vs `head_dim=256`). The
  vendored version now branches: if `cos.shape[-1] == q.shape[-1]` the
  fast path is unchanged; otherwise it splits Q/K into `(rot, pass)`,
  rotates only the leading slice, and concatenates them back. This
  matches `transformers.models.qwen3_5.modeling_qwen3_5.apply_rotary_pos_emb`.

* **`core/quantizer.py` — opt-out env var.** Added a check in
  `_try_enable_fused_triton`: setting `FUSED_TURBOQUANT_DISABLE_TRITON=1`
  forces the pure-PyTorch encode/decode path. Useful on dev boxes
  whose Triton JIT can't link `Python.h` (no `python3.X-dev` package).

* **`kernels/triton_attention.py` — pure-PyTorch fallback.** Added
  `_fused_qk_scores_rht_pytorch`, a math-equivalent reimplementation of
  the Triton kernel that unpacks the compressed key indices, gathers
  centroids, scales by per-vector norms, and runs the Q·K^T matmul
  through standard PyTorch ops. The dispatcher in `fused_qk_scores_rht`
  routes to this fallback when Triton is unavailable or
  `FUSED_TURBOQUANT_DISABLE_TRITON=1`. The Triton kernel path is
  unchanged when Triton is available.

* **No changes to `cache/`, `benchmark/`, or `vllm_plugin/`** beyond
  the import rewrite. The vLLM backend continues to behave exactly as
  upstream.
