## Modifications

Per Apache 2.0 §4(b), the changes made on top of upstream
`648b3641f96b6e95e091217220b94e4739fd4d82` are:

* **Added `__init__.py`** so the vendored directory functions as a
  regular Python package. Upstream ships these files in a flat
  directory and expects callers to add it to `sys.path`; we wanted
  clean `from eliza_training.quantization.qjl import ...` imports.

* **Parameterized `EMB_DIM` (head_dim) as a C++ template parameter.**
  Upstream hard-codes `#define EMB_DIM 128` at the top of every kernel.
  This is correct for Llama 2/3 and older 128-dim heads but fails to
  compile/run for 256-dim text-decoder heads. We changed:

    - `csrc/qjl_quant_kernel.cu`:
      `quantize_with_outliers_kernel` and `QJLQuantCudaTemplate` are now
      templated on `int EMB_DIM`. PYBIND11_MODULE explicitly instantiates
      `_h128` and `_h256` variants for every (T, Tproj) pair (10
      bindings total).
    - `csrc/qjl_score_kernel.cu`: same template parameterization on
      `calc_score_kernel` and `QJLScoreCudaTemplate`. 10 bindings.
    - `csrc/qjl_gqa_score_kernel.cu`: same template parameterization on
      `calc_gqa_score_kernel` and `QJLGQAScoreCudaTemplate`. 10
      bindings. The upstream `GQA_GROUP_SIZE=4` constant is unchanged —
      it gates the static `__shared__` query buffer's first dim and is
      independent of head_dim.
    - Each templated host wrapper adds a `TORCH_CHECK(emb_dim == EMB_DIM,
      ...)` guard so a wrong dispatch fails loud at the boundary instead
      of silently writing garbage.

* **Updated `qjl_kernel.py`** to dispatch by tensor `head_dim` to the
  matching `_h128` / `_h256` binding. The public function names
  (`qjl_quant`, `qjl_score`, `qjl_gqa_score`) and signatures are
  unchanged so downstream callers (`qjl_apply.py`,
  `LlamaAttention_QJL`, etc.) require no modifications. Also fixed an
  upstream typo (`tcuda_qjl_score` -> `cuda_qjl_score`) in the
  `qjl_score` float/float branch.

* **Added `build.sh`** that auto-detects the local GPU's compute
  capability via `nvidia-smi` and sets `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`
  accordingly. Adds `+PTX` to sm_120 so PyTorch can JIT-compile from
  PTX on toolchains without sm_120 SASS support. Provides actionable
  install-command output when `nvcc` or `Python.h` is missing.

* **Added `test_kernel_dims.py`** with a pure-PyTorch QJL reference
  quantizer that runs without CUDA, verifies the analytic compression
  ratio for both head_dim values across `proj_dim ∈ {128, 256, 512}`,
  and exercises the CUDA kernel for both head_dim instantiations when
  the extension built (SKIPs cleanly with apt commands otherwise).

* **Package-relative compiled imports.** `qjl_kernel.py` and `matmul.py`
  resolve extensions beside the installed `eliza_training.quantization.qjl`
  package instead of relying on global path mutation.

* **Removed unused `csrc/qjl_quant_values_kernel.cu`.** It was never included
  in `setup.py`, had no consumers, and contained unresolved upstream symbols
  and incorrect return values. The four built CUDA extensions are unchanged.

`new_pack.py` retains its upstream implementation; `setup.py` only gained
its build documentation.
