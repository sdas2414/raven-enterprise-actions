"""Integration test for the budget enforcement path through the watcher.

Verifies the bash watcher's contract by:
  1. Constructing an isolated ELIZA_STATE_DIR.
  2. Pointing the watcher at a fixture `train_vast.sh` (which always succeeds)
     and pre-seeding ``.vast_instance_id`` so the watcher reads it.
  3. Replacing the python ``eliza_training.lib.vast_budget enforce`` invocation
     with one that returns the hard-cap exit code (11).
  4. Running the watcher with ``ELIZA_VAST_BUDGET_DRY_RUN=1`` and a tiny
     ``ELIZA_VAST_WATCH_INTERVAL_S=1`` so a single poll happens then
     the watcher exits cleanly via the hard-cap branch.
  5. Asserting an incident log with kind="hard_cap_breach" was written.

The test isolates everything to a tmpdir — no real vastai binary or
network is touched.
