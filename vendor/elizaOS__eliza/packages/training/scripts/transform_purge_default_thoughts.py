"""Purge the literal default-thought strings from packed train.jsonl.

The dataset adapters were updated to use a varied thought-phrasing pool, but
existing `data/normalized/*.jsonl` files were generated before the fix and
still contain literal strings like `"Reply to the user."` injected as the
model's reasoning. Re-normalizing 75 GB to fix this is wasteful when we can
post-process the packed train.jsonl directly.

This script walks train.jsonl line by line. For each record where
`expectedResponse` starts with `thought: <literal default>`, replaces just
that line with a varied phrasing picked deterministically from the
adapter's pool (seeded by the user message).

Output: rewrites train.jsonl (and val.jsonl) in place via atomic temp file.

Usage:
