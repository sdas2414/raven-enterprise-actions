"""Fix the bug introduced by running transform_diversify_refusals multiple times:
when v2/v3 hit a record that v1 already prefixed with a paraphrase, the
matching refusal-pattern strips the templated remainder but the paraphrase
gets prepended a SECOND time (same idx → same stable_choice). Result:

    "Anytime! Anytime! In this case, I can help you ..."
    "I can only call the tools provided, and none of them fit. I can only
     call the tools provided, and none of them fit. In this case, ..."

This pass removes any case where any paraphrase appears twice consecutively
(separated only by sentence whitespace) at the start of a text: field.

Requires explicit input and output paths; use --in-place to replace the input.

# Match a duplicated paraphrase pattern. Two forms:
#   1. "P. P." — direct duplicate, separated by whitespace
#   2. "P. \"P.\"" — duplicate where the second copy is wrapped in inner
#      escaped quotes (this arises when v2/v3 ran on a record whose v1
#      paraphrase was already inside a JSON-quoted text: value, then v2
#      stripped the templated remainder and prepended the v1 paraphrase
#      again).
#
# Replacement: just \1 (single paraphrase). Important: do NOT consume the
# outer closing quote that delimits the text: value. The trailing
# `\\?["']?` matches *at most one* inner-quote character — enough for the
# escaped form, but not enough to eat the outer text: closing quote.
