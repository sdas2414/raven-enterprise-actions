# Build the CUDA + Triton extensions the eliza-1 quantization stack needs.
#
# This script is the single source of truth for "set up a fresh GPU box
# so that QJL, fused-TurboQuant, and friends can actually run." It is
# called by training/Dockerfile during image build, and is also the
# command operators run on a bare-metal Vast / Lambda / on-prem GPU.
#
# What it does
# ------------
#   1. Builds the vendored QJL CUDA kernels in scripts/quantization/qjl/
#      via `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`. Requires nvcc and
#      python<ver>-dev headers on the system.
#
#   2. Verifies fused_turboquant_vendored can be imported. Triton is
#      JIT-only — there is no AOT step we can run at install time, so
#      this is the closest we can get to "Triton compiler is wired up
#      correctly". The actual kernel JIT happens on first call inside
#      a CUDA context.
#
# What it does not do
# -------------------
#   - It does not install system packages. The Dockerfile is responsible
#     for apt-get installing nvcc + python-dev. On bare metal, the user
#     installs those manually (see scripts/quantization/qjl/build.sh).
#   - It does not build vllm or any inference-side kernel. `serve_vllm.py`
#     consumes prebuilt vllm wheels from the `serve` extra.
#
# Exit codes
# ----------
#   0  — QJL built successfully, fused_turboquant_vendored imported.
#   1  — QJL build failed (typically nvcc missing or wrong arch list).
#   2  — fused_turboquant_vendored import failed (Triton or torch issue).
