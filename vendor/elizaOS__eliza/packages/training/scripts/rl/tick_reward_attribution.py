Tick Reward Attribution

A single agent tick may contain multiple LLM calls with different purposes:
1. REASONING - Analysis and planning (should I trade?)
2. ACTION - Decision making (what trade to make?)
3. RESPONSE - Communication (what to say?)
4. EVALUATION - Self-assessment (how did I do?)

The global tick reward needs to be attributed back to individual calls
to train each prompt type effectively.

This module implements credit assignment from tick outcomes to individual LLM calls.

Input:

1. REASONING sample: Input -> <thought>...</thought>
   Reward: Attributed based on whether actions succeeded

2. ACTION sample: Input + thought context -> <actions>...</actions>
   Reward: Direct from action outcome (P&L, success)

3. RESPONSE sample: Input + thought + actions -> <text>...</text>
   Reward: From social engagement metrics

This allows the model to learn:
- Better reasoning that leads to good actions
- Better action selection given good reasoning
- Better responses given successful actions
