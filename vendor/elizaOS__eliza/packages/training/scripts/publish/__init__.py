"""Eliza-1 publish orchestrator package.

End-to-end runner that takes an already-quantized bundle directory,
verifies kernels, applies eval gates, builds the Eliza-1 manifest,
generates the README, and pushes the bundle into ``elizaos/eliza-1``
under ``bundles/<tier>/``.

There is no opt-out flag for any gate. ``--dry-run`` performs every check but does not push.
