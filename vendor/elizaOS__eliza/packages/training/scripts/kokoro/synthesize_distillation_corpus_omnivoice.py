"""G3 OmniVoice-same distillation corpus synthesis.

Uses Kokoro KPipeline conditioned on the **same voice ref_s** (either a
precomputed .bin from extract_voice_embedding.py or from HF
`hexgrad/Kokoro-82M` voices/) as the teacher — NOT af_bella.

This is F2's structural next-step per F2's post-mortem (§"What would actually
work", Option A): synthesize diverse text with the same-conditioned teacher so
the full-FT student learns same timbre rather than af_bella timbre.

If `--voice-bin` points to the mel-fit ref_s .bin produced from real same audio,
the teacher is as close to same's voice as Kokoro can produce. The result is
still synthetic but is same-characteristic rather than af_bella-characteristic.

Usage::

    python3 synthesize_distillation_corpus_omnivoice.py \\
        --voice-bin /tmp/kokoro-f2/melfit-5/af_same.bin \\
        --out-dir packages/training/data/voice/same-distill \\
        --target-min 60.0

Output layout::

    <out_dir>/
      wavs_norm/         24 kHz mono PCM16 WAVs (synth_NNNN.wav)
      train_list.txt     LJSpeech-format lines (90%)
