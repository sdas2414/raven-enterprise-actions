"""Self-distillation corpus synthesis for Kokoro same fine-tune.

Uses the Kokoro TTS engine with the best available same voice embedding
(mel-fit ref_s from extract_voice_embedding.py) to synthesize 30-60 min of
diverse text. This is teacher-student distillation: the teacher is the
frozen Kokoro model with same ref_s; the student is the fine-tuned model.

Text corpus: diverse English sentences from built-in COCO captions-style +
LibriTTS-style short paragraphs. The emphasis is on:
  - Varied sentence lengths (5-25 words)
  - Conversational register (like the *Her* same corpus)
  - Emotional variety (question, statement, exclamation)
  - No domain-specific jargon

Output directory layout:
  <out_dir>/
    wavs_norm/         24 kHz mono PCM16 WAVs (synth_NNNN.wav)
    train_list.txt     LJSpeech-format lines
    val_list.txt       LJSpeech-format lines (10%)
