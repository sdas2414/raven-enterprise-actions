"""Eliza-1 bundle license attestations.

Single source of truth for the `licenses/` directory of every Eliza-1
bundle: which file maps to which upstream license, the SPDX id, the
upstream source repo/URL, the copyright holder, and the actual license
text to embed.

The publish orchestrator consumes this module to (a) write the
`licenses/` set + the `licenses/license-manifest.json` sidecar when
finalizing a bundle, and (b) refuse to publish a bundle whose
`licenses/` set is partial or whose embedded text does not match the
canonical SPDX text.

License texts live next to this module under `license_texts/`:

- `Apache-2.0.txt`        — the canonical Apache License 2.0
- `MIT-silero-vad.txt`    — the Silero VAD MIT license (with its
                            copyright line; the bare MIT body is the
                            same for omnivoice.cpp's MIT code clause)
- `CC-BY-4.0.txt`         — Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
                            International legalcode
- `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.txt`   — Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-
                            ShareAlike 4.0 International legalcode

`base-v1` semantics (see `eliza1_manifest.py`): the shipped bytes are
the upstream BASE GGUFs, so the license for each component is the
*upstream component's* license, not a fresh "trained Eliza-1" license.
`LICENSE.eliza-1` is the project-level umbrella notice: the bundle as a
whole is governed by its most-restrictive component term (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0
when a tier includes a CC-BY-NC-SA component such as OmniVoice singing
or an experimental wakeword head), hence the non-commercial open-source
positioning in `packages/inference/AGENTS.md` §1.
