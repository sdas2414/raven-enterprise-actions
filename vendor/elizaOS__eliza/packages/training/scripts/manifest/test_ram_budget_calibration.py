"""Calibration invariants for the per-tier RAM budgets.

`packages/inference/AGENTS.md` section 8 + section 6: the manifest `ramBudgetMb.recommended`
is what the 30-turn endurance gate (`thirtyTurnOk`) compares the fused
llama-server's peak RSS against. The 2026-05-11 e2e voice-loop benchmark
(`packages/inference/verify/bench_results/e2e_loop_2026-05-11.json`) measured
~4828 MB (2b) server peak RSS in voice-on mode — the
fused process keeps text + MTP drafter + OmniVoice (base/tokenizer/DAC/
HuBERT/sem-enc) + ASR + mmproj all resident. The budgets in
`DEFAULT_RAM_BUDGET_MB` must therefore (a) be identical across the three
staging entry points that emit a manifest, and (b) leave headroom above the
measured peak so `thirtyTurnOk` is achievable on the bench host.
