Comprehensive Tests for Quality Utilities (quality_utils.py)

Tests cover:
- XML structure validation (decisions tags, attributes)
- Reasoning-action alignment (directional, financial literacy)
- Reasoning coherence heuristics (structure, conclusions, vocabulary)
- Detailed tick quality scoring
- Archetype-specific quality weights
- Tick quality score calculation
