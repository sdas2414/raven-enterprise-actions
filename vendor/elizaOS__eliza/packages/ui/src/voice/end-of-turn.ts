/**
 * Semantic end-of-turn detection for voice capture.
 *
 * The platform recognizers finalize a turn purely on a fixed silence window
 * (Android SODA ~700ms, web VAD ~900ms). That cuts a slow speaker off the
 * instant they pause to think mid-sentence ("schedule a meeting with… [pause]
 * …Bob"). The {@link TurnAggregator} below adds a lightweight, deterministic
 * semantic layer ON TOP of the recognizer's finals: when the accumulated
 * transcript looks syntactically UNFINISHED (ends on a conjunction / preposition
 * / article) it holds the turn open and keeps listening; when it looks complete
 * (sentence-final punctuation, a short command, or a clause that doesn't trail
 * off) it commits immediately so the agent still replies snappily.
 *
 * The syntactic scorer itself is the single canonical heuristic in
 * `@elizaos/voice` — the SAME definition the plugin's Tier-3
 * `HeuristicEotClassifier` (and, through it, the fused composite EOT) consume,
 * so the shell capture path and the native voice engine never drift.
 */
