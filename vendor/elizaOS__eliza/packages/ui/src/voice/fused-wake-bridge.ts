/**
 * Renderer bridge for the fused on-device wake path (#9953 / #9880).
 *
 * The battery-efficient fused openWakeWord runtime (`libwakeword` via
 * `wake-word-ggml.ts`, exercised by `wakeword-cpp`) runs in the agent/native
 * process, not the renderer. Per `VOICE_UX.md`, only the Swabble Web-Speech
 * fallback was ever bridged to the UI; the fused path was built + tested but
 * never reached `useWakeController`.
 *
 * This module is the missing seam: the native host forwards fused wake stages to
 * the renderer as a `window` CustomEvent, and `useWakeController` subscribes to
 * them through {@link subscribeFusedWake} when it declares the `openWakeWord`
 * capability. The host signals availability by setting
 * `window.__ELIZA_FUSED_WAKE__ = true` before the controller mounts (or it can
 * just start emitting events — {@link probeFusedWake} only gates the default
 * capability set, it does not invent a subscription).
 *
 * Keeping the transport a plain DOM CustomEvent means it is identical to drive
 * from the native bridge, a WebSocket push handler, or a synthetic test — which
 * is exactly how the Phase 2 integration test exercises it.
