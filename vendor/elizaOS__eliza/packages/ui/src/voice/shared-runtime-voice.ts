 * resolve directly to that route off their active base and are left unchanged
 * (#15395). With no cloud auth/config, the on-device proxy path is preserved.
 *
 * Voice/model parity with the proxy: in the default (unpinned) setup the direct

 * `LEGACY_DEFAULT_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`, which the worker's provider selection
 * (`packages/cloud/api/v1/voice/tts/provider-selection.ts`) explicitly treats
 * as "caller did not pin a voice", identical to an omitted `voiceId`. The
 * residual gap is a server-side `ELIZAOS_CLOUD_TTS_VOICE` / `_MODEL` env pin:
 * those env vars live only in the agent-server process and are exposed through
 * no renderer channel (not boot config, not `VoiceConfig`, not `getConfig()`),
 * so the client cannot detect a pin to route around it. When the caller DOES
 * know a voice/model (any future renderer channel), pass `voiceId`/`modelId`
 * here and the direct body carries them; until then, operators with an env pin
 * get the worker default on the direct path — a documented limitation, and the
 * direct→proxy failure fallback in `useVoiceChat` does not cover it (the direct
 * request succeeds, with the unpinned voice).
 *
 * Pure so the routing decision is unit-testable without a network or DOM.
