/**
 * Routes the plugin-workflow HTTP surface (`/api/automations`, `/api/workflow/*`,
 * `/api/triggers*`) to a runtime that actually hosts it.
 *
 * The bundled mobile on-device agent never loads `@elizaos/plugin-workflow`
 * (see MOBILE_CORE_PLUGINS in `packages/agent/src/runtime/core-plugins.ts` —
 * phones cannot host the workflow runtime), so every workflow call against the
 * phone runtime 404s and the Automations view dead-ends even when the device is
 * signed into Eliza Cloud. When the active client points at that on-device
 * runtime AND a Cloud agent is linked in the agent-profile registry, the
 * workflow-surface client methods target the Cloud agent's API base instead:
 * a dedicated runtime serves the real data, and a shared-tier base answers with
 * the typed `workflow_requires_dedicated` gate the feed already renders as the
 * designed upgrade state. With no linked Cloud agent the calls stay on the
 * active base and the feed keeps its explicit unavailable state — this module
 * never fabricates a healthy response.
 *
 * Consumed by `client-automations.ts`, `client-workflow.ts`, and the trigger
 * methods in `client-agent.ts` (all of plugin-workflow's routes), plus
 * `AutomationsFeed` for cache-keying and upgrade-agent-id parsing. Scheduled
 * tasks (`plugin-scheduling`) run on-device and are intentionally NOT routed.
