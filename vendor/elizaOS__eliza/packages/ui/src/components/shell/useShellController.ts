  // ── App suspend / resume: keep voice capture from getting stuck (#voice-V1) ──
  //
  // On the installed iOS PWA, backgrounding the app suspends the WebAudio graph:
  // the WAV recorder's `ScriptProcessorNode` stops firing, but nothing tears the
  // capture down, so on resume the UI is stuck in a phantom "recording" state
  // with an orphaned getUserMedia MediaStream (iOS keeps the mic indicator lit)
  // and the next tap early-returns against the stale `captureRef`.
  //
  // This extends #15179's lifecycle bridge (which already dispatches
  // APP_PAUSE/APP_RESUME on the web PWA and handles chat resync) rather than
  // duplicating it:
  //   - APP_PAUSE: discard any in-flight capture (release the mic, reset UI) so
  //     nothing stalls across suspension. Remember whether the mic was live so
  //     resume can re-arm it.
  //   - APP_RESUME: if the mic was hands-free-live at suspend (or always-on
  //     hands-free is engaged), re-open capture the instant we foreground
  //     instead of waiting for a user tap. The existing re-listen loop also
  //     covers this via state deps, but a direct nudge avoids a dead mic when
  //     the loop's deps didn't change across the suspend.
