/**
 * Auth stub for the home-screen fixture bundle.

 * The fixture renders the REAL widget components, and since #11084

 * `useIsAuthenticated()` before fetching. The fixture has no auth backend, so
 * without this stub the shared auth snapshot stays in the "loading" phase
 * forever, no gated widget ever fetches its injected data, and every
 * per-plugin card self-hides — the harness then can't prove the real widgets
 * parse the seeded data. Render as an authenticated local session instead;
 * the data still flows through the stubbed client/window.fetch transport.
