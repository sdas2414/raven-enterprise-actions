/**
 * esbuild options the proactive-suggestions browser fixture is bundled with,
 * shared by `run-suggestions-e2e.mjs` (phase 2) and its regression test so the
 * two can never drift.
 *
 * The fixture graph reaches server-only edges that are dead at render in a
 * headless page: `state/parsers` re-exports streaming-text helpers whose
 * canonical home is the `@elizaos/core` barrel, and the `api/client` barrel
 * value-imports `@elizaos/core` from `client-cloud`. Vite resolves core's
 * published `browser` condition in production, but `eliza-source` outranks
 * `browser` for esbuild, so those edges must be aliased or stubbed or the
 * browser build fails on `node:*` builtins.
