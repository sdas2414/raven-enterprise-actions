/**
 * Per-view live-resource counters — the "how many live things does this view
 * hold" registry that the shell has never had (issue #10202, criterion #5).
 *
 * The render/frame telemetry stack measures how OFTEN a view renders; this
 * measures what a view RETAINS: active subscriptions/listeners, pending timers,
 * and mounted heavy resources (WebGL contexts, audio/video/media streams).
 * Those are the quantities that leak — a listener added without cleanup, an
 * interval never cleared, an AudioContext never closed — and that no existing
 * counter sees.
 *
 * Contract: every `track*` call increments the live count for a viewId and
 * returns a single-use disposer that decrements it. A well-behaved view returns
 * to zero when its resources are released; a LEAKY view (disposer never called)
 * stays above zero after unmount, which is exactly the signal the leak test
 * asserts on. We intentionally do NOT auto-zero a view's counters on
 * unmount/evict: that would hide the very leak we want visible. The map is
 * bounded by the number of distinct view ids (~the view matrix), so it never
 * grows unboundedly.
 *
 * Pure + framework-free (no React, no DOM) so it unit-tests in any env and the
 * pausable hooks / media-creation seams can call into it from anywhere.
