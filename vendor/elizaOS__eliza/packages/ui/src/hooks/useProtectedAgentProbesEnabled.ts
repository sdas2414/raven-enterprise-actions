/**
 * Gate for shell data loaders that hit protected (auth-required) agent API
 * routes on mount.
 *
 * The one origin where the shell must NOT probe those routes before a session
 * exists is the shared Eliza Cloud web app (`cloud.eliza.app` and the other
 * control-plane hosts): its same-origin `/api/*` is the managed cloud endpoint,
 * so every protected GET fired during fresh onboarding 401s and Chromium logs
 * each as a console error — the first-run noise of #16242. The in-chat first-run
 * conductor owns Cloud sign-in there; once a session exists the probes resume.
 *
 * Everywhere else (localhost, desktop/mobile local agents, self-hosted remotes)
 * the same-origin agent needs no cloud auth, so probes fire immediately — no
 * auth round-trip is inserted into those hot paths. Consumers:
 * `notifications-boot`, `useWeather`, `useRuntimeMode`.
