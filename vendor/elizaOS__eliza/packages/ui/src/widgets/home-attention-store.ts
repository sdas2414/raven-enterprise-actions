/**
 * Home-attention store (#9143).
 *
 * Data-driven home widgets (calendar, goals, finances, health, …) carry their
 * urgency in their *own* fetched data — an overdrawn balance, an at-risk goal,
 * an event starting in 10 minutes — not in the shared activity-event or
 * notification streams the home ranker reads. This store is the seam that lets
 * such a widget feed its current importance back to the ranker: the widget
 * publishes a weight while the attention-worthy condition holds and clears it
 * otherwise; {@link WidgetHost} merges these into `rankHomeWidgets` so the
 * widget floats up by *its own* state.
 *
 * Unlike activity/notification signals, a self-published weight represents a
 * *sustained state* (the balance is still negative), so it must NOT decay —
 * the store holds only `widgetKey → weight` and the consumer stamps `now` at
 * read time (age 0 ⇒ full weight) until the widget clears it.
