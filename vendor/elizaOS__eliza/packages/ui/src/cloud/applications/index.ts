/**
 * Applications cloud domain — barrel + route registration. Applications are
 * the developer **cloud OAuth app** object whose id is the OAuth `client_id`
 * (used by `/app-auth/authorize`) — distinct from the local installed-apps
 * surface.
 *
 *  - {@link ApplicationsRoute} (default export of `ApplicationsPage`) is the
 *    list view at `cloud/apps`.
 *  - {@link ApplicationDetailRoute} is the 9-tab detail view at
 *    `cloud/apps/:id` (overview / monetization / earnings / hosting /
 *    domains / analytics / promote / users / settings).
 *
 * Both routes register **at import time** against the {@link CloudRouteDef}
 * registry. The `CloudRouterShell` carries a `cloud/apps/create →
 * /cloud/apps` redirect; the detail route's UUID guard sends any non-UUID
 * id (including `create`) back to the list, so the two are consistent.
