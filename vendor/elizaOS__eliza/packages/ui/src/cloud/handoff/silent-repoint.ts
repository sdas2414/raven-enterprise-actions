/**
 * Silently re-point the live client from the shared bridge to the dedicated
 * agent — the handoff's "invisible switch".
 *
 * This is the handoff-ONLY alternative to `switchAgentProfile`. The global
 * profile switch (`AppContext.tsx`) intentionally:
 *   - `clearAllChatDrafts()` — wipes the composer (conversation ids are
 *     per-account, so a manual account switch can't carry a draft over), and
 *   - dispatches `SWITCH_AGENT` — which re-enters the startup coordinator
 *     (`ready → polling-backend`), a phase that is NOT shell-paintable, so
 *     `App.tsx` swaps the whole shell for `<StartupScreen/>` (the full-screen
 *     flash).
 * Both are correct for a manual switch but WRONG for the handoff: the dedicated
 * agent already holds the copied transcript on the SAME conversation id, the
 * user is mid-conversation, and the composer may hold an unsent draft. So the
 * handoff re-points in place instead:
 *   - persist the serving runtime on the same logical profile (so a reboot
 *     restores Dedicated without inventing a second personal identity),
 *   - re-point the API/WS base seamlessly via `client.repointBaseUrl` (which
 *     reconnects the WS in place — no visible drop, no coordinator re-entry),
 *   - set the bearer token,
 * and DELIBERATELY does NOT clear drafts and does NOT dispatch `SWITCH_AGENT`.
 * The chat surface stays mounted on the same conversation id throughout.
