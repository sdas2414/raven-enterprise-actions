/**
 * `eliza.os-intent/v1` — the one structural intent vocabulary that unifies how
 * chat, voice, and transcription are launched across every entry point: iOS App
 * Intents / Siri, Android app-actions + shortcuts, desktop deep links, tray and
 * widget controls, notification taps, and in-app invocations. A launch surface
 * emits a typed {@link OsIntent}; the routing authority (`router.ts`) decides —
 * from STRUCTURAL fields only — whether to dispatch it to the one shared shell
 * controller, dedupe it, block it on an unmet prerequisite, gate an auto-start on
 * consent, or degrade visibly on a device that cannot honor it.
 *
 * Design rules that keep routing deterministic and safe:
 *   - Behavior derives from the discriminant `type`, the declared prerequisites,
 *     and the routing context — NEVER from prompt or transcript text. The native
 *     surfaces historically emitted a free-form `action` string
 *     (`ask`/`chat`/`voice`/…); that string is untrusted input mapped to a typed
 *     intent at the decode boundary (`decode.ts`) and never inspected again.
 *   - `intentId` is the stable idempotency key. The same launch — redelivered by
 *     a retried deep link, a re-tapped notification, a second window, or a
 *     restored/crashed-then-reopened session — carries the same `intentId`, so
 *     the authority applies it exactly once.
 *   - Auto-start intents (mic capture) are consent-gated and reversible: a
 *     `start-*` intent only fires with recorded consent, and every `start-*` has
 *     a matching `stop-*` that is always allowed (you can always turn capture
 *     off).
 *
 * This module is pure type + constant declarations (runtime validation lives in
 * `decode.ts`, routing in `router.ts`) so it is safe to import from any layer,
 * native bridge shim included.
