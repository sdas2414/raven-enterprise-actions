 * value once at module load and threads it through these helpers so the
 * recovery retry unions rather than replaces the operator's list, and every
 * successful boot settles the env var back to the operator's value instead
 * of deleting it (deletion made any later in-process runtime re-bootstrap
 * silently resurrect every operator-skipped plugin).
