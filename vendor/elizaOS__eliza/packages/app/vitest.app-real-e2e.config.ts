 * Config for the `test/app/*.{real,live}.e2e.test.ts` browser-driven real e2e
 * suite (qa-checklist, memory-relationships,
 * streaming-visible-text). These drive a real renderer via puppeteer/playwright
 * against a real app runtime + a real model provider; each self-skips
 * (`describeIf`/CAN_RUN) unless `ELIZA_LIVE_TEST=1` + a provider is present.
 *
 * The default `vitest.config.ts` explicitly EXCLUDES these files and only scans
 * `src/`, so before this config existed nothing ran them — they were dark.
 * Invoke via the `test:app-real-e2e` script. The root `test:e2e:heavy` script
 * runs this config narrowed to the qa-checklist and memory-relationships files
 * for the release gate (`.github/workflows/release-electrobun.yml`); the full
 * suite here has no other scheduled CI caller yet.
