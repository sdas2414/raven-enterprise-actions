 * process tree on a fixed 1.5 s fuse, without ever awaiting a child `exit`
 * event. That fuse is shorter than the bounded teardown children are entitled
 * to perform: the Discord connector alone may spend up to 10 s draining
 * in-flight turns plus 2 s reconciling status reactions before its process
 * exits (`plugins/plugin-discord/shutdown-drain.ts`), so the drain that merged
 * in #17749 could never finish under the dev supervisor (elizaOS/eliza#16318).
 *
 * This module inverts that contract. Supervisor exit follows child exit
 * directly instead of a fixed schedule; only a child that outlives the window
 * is escalated to SIGKILL, per straggler and loudly, so a drain timeout is an
 * observable event instead of a silent kill.
 * The wait stays bounded end to end (window + kill grace): a child that
 * survives even SIGKILL delivery cannot wedge supervisor exit.
