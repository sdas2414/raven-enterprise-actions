/**
 * CMake flags a fused build must add on top of the per-target defaults.
 * The fused lib `elizainference` (libelizainference.so — the TTS+ASR+LLM
 * artifact the APK bundles) is guarded by `if(ELIZA_FUSE_OMNIVOICE)` in the
 * fork's root CMakeLists.txt, while the omnivoice TTS subtree (and its CLI
 * drivers) is guarded by `LLAMA_BUILD_OMNIVOICE`. The pinned fork has NO
 * redirect wiring one flag to the other, so BOTH must be set explicitly —
 * with only `LLAMA_BUILD_OMNIVOICE` the `elizainference` target is never
 * defined and `cmake --build --target elizainference` silently no-ops, which
 * is exactly why x86_64 shipped without libelizainference.so.
 *
 * Self-contained static fuse (device-proven on a real Pixel, arm64/bionic):
 *   - `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` makes llama/ggml/mtmd build as STATIC `.a`
 *     archives instead of shared `.so` files.
 *   - `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON` compiles those `.a`s with -fPIC so
 *     they fold cleanly into the still-SHARED libelizainference.so.
 *   - `elizainference` and `omnivoice` are declared with an explicit
 *     `add_library(... SHARED ...)` in tools/omnivoice/CMakeLists.txt, so they
 *     stay shared `.so` even under BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF.
 *   The net result is ONE self-contained libelizainference.so whose only
 *   DT_NEEDED entries are libc/libm/libdl — no libllama.so / libggml*.so
 *   runtime siblings to stage or resolve via LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
 *
 * `LLAMA_BUILD_KOKORO=ON` makes the fork's root-CMakeLists embed-as-library
 * hook fold kokoro_lib into elizainference (ABI v10) when the fused build runs
 * with LLAMA_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF (the bionic JNI path). On the cross-compile path
 * (compile-libllama.ts) LLAMA_BUILD_TOOLS defaults ON, so kokoro is added by
 * tools/CMakeLists.txt instead; verify-fused-symbols.ts gates the resulting
 * libelizainference.so on the eliza_inference_kokoro_* exports so a kokoro-less
 * fuse fails the build rather than shipping silently.
