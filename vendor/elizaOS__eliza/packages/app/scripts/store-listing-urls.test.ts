/**
 * Contract tests for the support/privacy/repository URLs that ship inside store
 * iOS fastlane listing metadata.
 *
 * Store reviewers follow these URLs literally, so a dead one blocks a listing
 * rather than degrading it. Two failure modes are pinned here because both have
 * already shipped: support/source destinations that reference the retired
 * `elizaos/elizaos-app` GitHub repo (the org/repo no longer resolves), and Eliza
 * Cloud paths that do not match a route registered in
 * `packages/ui/src/cloud/public-pages/register.ts`. The
 * cloud app serves an SPA fallback, so an unregistered path still answers HTTP
 * 200 — only the route registry proves the page exists, which is why this suite
 * reads that file as the source of truth instead of probing the network.
 *
 * Deterministic and offline: every assertion is a pure read of repository files.
 * Runs under node:test (see mas-smoke.test.ts for the same pattern); excluded
 * from vitest in packages/app/vitest.config.ts.
