/**
 * webhook-event-registry.ts — a runtime-extensible set of valid webhook
 * event-type names.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * the core's webhook event types are a CLOSED TypeScript union
 * (`WebhookEventType` in ./index.ts) and the API's webhook-config validation
 * checks a candidate event against a fixed list. that is correct for the core's
 * own events, but it means a PLUGIN that emits its own event type ("foo.bar")
 * cannot have that event accepted: the closed union rejects it at the type
 * level, and the config validator rejects it at runtime.
 *
 * Phase 2 of the plugin SDK lets a plugin DECLARE the event-type names it emits
 * (`StewardPlugin.webhookEvents`). the plugin host registers those names here at
 * composition time, so the runtime set of valid event types becomes:
 *
 *     core event types  ∪  every enabled plugin's declared event types
 *
 * the webhook-config validator and dispatcher consult this set instead of a
 * frozen list, so a plugin's event flows end-to-end without the core's union
 * having to enumerate it ahead of time. core events are ALWAYS valid (they are
 * seeded into the registry and can never be removed), so a plugin can only ADD
 * to the valid set, never shrink it.
 *
 * This is intentionally a tiny, dependency-free runtime primitive in
 * `server/shared` so both the API (config validation) and the webhooks dispatcher
 * can consult the same registry. It carries NO http/framework types.
