/**
 * Engine-internal "route to manual approval" signal.
 *
 * The public `PolicyResult` (in `server/shared`) only distinguishes pass/fail.
 * Some evaluators need a third outcome: "this policy did not pass, but the
 * transaction should be queued for human review rather than hard-rejected."
 * Reputation-threshold's `require-approval` action is the canonical case.
 *
 * We express that as an OPTIONAL boolean flag layered on top of `PolicyResult`.
 * Because the property is optional and JSON-serialisable, a result carrying it
 * is structurally still a `PolicyResult`: it flows through `EvaluationResult.
 * results`, audit events, and persistence without any schema change, and code
 * that ignores the flag simply sees a normal failed policy.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (fail-closed contract): the flag is ONLY meaningful when
 * `passed === false`. A passing result never needs manual approval, and the
 * engine must never treat a *hard* failure (block, default-deny, missing
 * inputs, unknown policy type) as "needs manual approval" just because some
 * other policy requested it. The engine therefore routes to manual approval
 * only when EVERY non-passing hard policy explicitly carries the flag (see
 * `engine.ts`). Absence of the flag means hard deny.
