/**
 * policy-rule-registry.ts — a runtime-extensible registry of plugin-contributed
 * policy-rule evaluators.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * the core's policy dispatch (`evaluatePolicy` in ./evaluators.ts) is a closed
 * `switch (rule.type)` over the ~16 core rule types, with a `default:` that denies
 * an unknown type. that is correct for the core's own rules, but a PLUGIN that
 * owns its own rule type (e.g. a venue-specific gate) cannot have that type
 * evaluated: it falls into `default:` and is denied as "Unknown policy type".
 *
 * Phase 2b of the plugin SDK lets a plugin DECLARE a rule type + evaluator
 * (`StewardPlugin.policyRules`). the plugin host registers those evaluators HERE
 * at composition time. `evaluatePolicy`'s `default:` consults this registry BEFORE
 * returning "Unknown policy type": if a plugin registered an evaluator for the
 * rule's type, that evaluator runs; otherwise the deny is unchanged.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — CORE BEHAVIOR IS UNTOUCHED. the 16 core `case` arms are not changed
 * in any way; the registry is consulted ONLY in the `default:` arm, i.e. ONLY for
 * a rule type that is not a core type. a core policy decision is byte-identical
 * before and after this phase. the registry can never shadow a core rule type:
 * registration FAILS CLOSED (throws) on a `type` that is a core type or that a
 * prior plugin already registered.
 *
 * This is a process-wide module singleton (the {@link policyRuleRegistry} export)
 * so the free `evaluatePolicy` function and the `PolicyEngine` both see the same
 * registered evaluators. The plugin host populates it at the composition root.
 * Tests that want isolation can construct their own {@link PolicyRuleRegistry}
 * and route through it, or use {@link policyRuleRegistry} and clear it.
