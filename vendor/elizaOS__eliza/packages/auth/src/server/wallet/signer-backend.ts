/**
 * SignerBackend — the honest threshold/MPC analog of {@link KeystoreBackend}.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (see D1-MPC-DECISION-2026-07-30.md §1, §7):
 * The existing `KeystoreBackend` contract is `encrypt(privateKey) -> EncryptedKey`
 * / `decrypt(EncryptedKey) -> privateKey`. That shape is *fundamentally
 * incompatible* with threshold signing: the whole point of FROST / MPC is that a
 * raw `privateKey` string NEVER exists in one place, so there is nothing to
 * `encrypt` and nothing for `decrypt` to hand back. Shoehorning threshold into
 * `KeystoreBackend` would force a backend to lie about being able to return a raw
 * key. Instead we introduce this sibling interface.
 *
 * The defining property is {@link SignerBackendCapabilities.canReturnRawKey}:
 * it is the literal type `false`. There is NO method on this interface that
 * exports private key material. `sign()` produces a signature via a threshold
 * ceremony; `generate()` runs a distributed-key-generation (DKG) or
 * trusted-dealer ceremony that yields only a public {@link ThresholdKeyRef}. A
 * backend that could return a raw key would use `KeystoreBackend`, not this.
 *
 * The classic AES/KMS/PKCS#11 path (KeystoreBackend) is untouched and remains
 * the default. Threshold signing is opt-in per wallet. See
 * `packages/auth/KEYSTORE-BACKENDS.md` for how the two relate.
