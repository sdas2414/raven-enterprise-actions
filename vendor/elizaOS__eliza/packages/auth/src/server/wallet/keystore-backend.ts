/**
 * KeystoreBackend — pluggable persistence interface for private-key material.
 *
 * The default `KeyStore` from `./keystore` is a single-process AES-256-GCM
 * backend: keys live in the application DB, encrypted at rest with a master
 * password derived via scrypt. That model is the right answer for most
 * deployments — simple, auditable, no external dependencies.
 *
 * Operators with different trust requirements (threshold/MPC signing, TEE-
 * attested execution, cloud HSM custody) can ship their own backend by
 * implementing this interface and wiring it in via VaultConfig. The vault
 * does not assume anything about how `encrypt`/`decrypt` are implemented;
 * it only requires that the returned `EncryptedKey` round-trips through
 * `decrypt`.
 *
 * This file defines the contract, not an MPC implementation. Shipping a
 * full threshold-signing protocol from inside this monorepo would be
 * theater — the security comes from running multiple independent operators,
 * which is an operational concern outside the codebase. The interface here
 * is the plug, not the network.
