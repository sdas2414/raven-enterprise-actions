"""Regression tests for the vendored MINT code grader (``upstream/mint/utils/exec.py``).

The grader runs untrusted, model-generated solutions in a child process. Upstream
human-eval used a *local closure* as the process target, which only works under the
``fork`` start method (the child inherits the parent address space). Under the
default ``spawn`` start method (macOS / Windows, and the Python 3.14 default) the
target is pickled, a local closure raises ``Can't pickle local object``, the child
never runs, the result list stays empty, and every code task is silently scored as a
failure regardless of model output.

The fix hoists the target to a module-level ``_unsafe_execute`` so it is picklable
under both ``spawn`` and ``fork``. These tests pin the three real verdicts and force
the ``spawn`` start method explicitly so the guard is meaningful on fork-default
Linux CI, not just on the macOS spawn default.
