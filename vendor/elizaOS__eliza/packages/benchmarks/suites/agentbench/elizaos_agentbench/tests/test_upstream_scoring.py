"""
Integration tests for adapter scoring against upstream-format tasks.

These exercise the DB / KG / OS / LTP scoring paths using the real
upstream loaders and the deterministic ``SmartMockRuntime``. We don't
assert specific scores - the mock runtime is not a capable LLM - we
just verify the *scoring code* is exercised on upstream-format tasks
and produces well-formed results.
