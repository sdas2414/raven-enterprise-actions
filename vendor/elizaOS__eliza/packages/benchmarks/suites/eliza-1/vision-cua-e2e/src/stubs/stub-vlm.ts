/**
 * STUB FOR HARNESS WIRING — replace with the real eliza-1 IMAGE_DESCRIPTION
 * handler before treating any results as real benchmarks.
 *
 * This module exists so the E2E pipeline can be wired, exercised, and CI-gated
 * without paid inference. It returns canned outputs for the three known
 * fixtures (single-display 1920x1080, ultra-wide 5120x1440, and the
 * multi-display composite).
 *
 * Public contract this file fakes:
 *   - `runtime.useModel(IMAGE_DESCRIPTION, { imageUrl, prompt })` in plugin-vision
 *     (see plugins/plugin-vision/src/service.ts ~line 1057). When eliza-1 is
 *     loaded locally it owns the IMAGE_DESCRIPTION slot. This stub mimics that
 *     handler signature for both scene-description and bbox grounding.
 *
 * Replace by:
 *   1. Setting ELIZA_VISION_CUA_E2E_REAL=1.
 *   2. Booting an `IAgentRuntime` with @elizaos/plugin-local-inference loaded
 *      (it registers eliza-1 against IMAGE_DESCRIPTION).
 *   3. Wiring `runReal()` in `pipeline.ts` to call `runtime.useModel(...)`
 *      instead of `StubVlm.describe()` / `StubVlm.ground()`.
