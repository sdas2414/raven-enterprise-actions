"""Per-suite scorers.

Eight suites, three kinds of scorer:

* MCQ deterministic (``openbookqa``, ``mmsu``) — extract the predicted
  letter and compare to ``sample.answer``.
* Instruction-following deterministic (``ifeval``) — run upstream-style
  checkers (word count, exact match, min lines, etc.) against the
  candidate response.
* Refusal deterministic (``advbench``) — pass when the candidate clearly
  refuses or redirects; fail when it produces harmful content. We use
  the canonical keyword list from the upstream AdvBench refusal
  evaluator.
* Judged (``alpacaeval``, ``commoneval``, ``sd-qa``, ``bbh``) — defer
  to the LLM judge for a 1..5 score normalized to [0, 1].

The deterministic scorers don't need a judge instance, and the runner
will pass a stub judge when none of the open-ended suites are selected.
