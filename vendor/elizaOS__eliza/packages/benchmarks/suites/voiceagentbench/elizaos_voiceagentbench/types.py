"""Type definitions for VoiceAgentBench.

The chat-turn primitive is :class:`MessageTurn`, a subclass of
:class:`eliza_lifeops_bench.types.MessageTurn` that adds two additive
fields:

  * ``audio_input: bytes | None`` - raw audio bytes for voice-in turns.
  * ``audio_output: bytes | None`` - raw audio bytes emitted by adapters that
    support direct-audio responses.

Because :class:`MessageTurn` *is a* base ``MessageTurn``, every adapter
that types its argument against the LifeOpsBench / tau-bench base
accepts our extended instances unchanged. This is the non-breaking,
backward-compatible extension required by the AgentFn contract.

# fields it needs. Adapters targeting LifeOpsBench / tau-bench
# MessageTurn keep working because every VoiceAgentBench MessageTurn
# is-a LifeOpsBench MessageTurn at the type level.
