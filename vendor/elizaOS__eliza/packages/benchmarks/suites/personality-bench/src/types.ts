/**
 * @fileoverview Public type contracts for the personality benchmark judge.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *  - All fields are required unless an axis is genuinely nullable.
 *  - `Verdict` is a closed enum: PASS, FAIL, NEEDS_REVIEW. NEEDS_REVIEW is the
 *    conservative fallback whenever sub-layers disagree. The judge never
 *    silently picks one side.
 *  - `LayerResult.confidence` is in [0,1]. Phrase-check confidence is
 *    deterministic (1.0 when regex matches, 0.0 when it does not, with a small
 *    band of 0.5 for "ambiguous" cases). LLM-judge confidence is the parsed
 *    log-prob style score the model returns or, lacking that, a fixed value.
