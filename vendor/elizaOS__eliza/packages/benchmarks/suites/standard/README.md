# Standard academic benchmarks

MMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K, and MT-Bench adapters. The default direct endpoint
measures model quality. Set `BENCHMARK_HARNESS` to `eliza`, `hermes`, or
`openclaw` to measure that runtime through its adapter instead. Keep direct
model results separate from runtime comparisons. No build step is needed.

With Python 3.11+ and the benchmark dependencies installed, run from the repository root:

```bash
# Run a benchmark (requires provider credentials)
PYTHONPATH=packages python3 -m benchmarks.suites.standard.mmlu --provider openai --model <model> --output /tmp/mmlu-out
# Test the adapters
PYTHONPATH=packages python3 -m pytest packages/benchmarks/suites/standard/tests
```
