"""Load real elizaOS trajectories from disk for LifeOpsBench evaluation.

elizaOS persists trajectories under
``~/.eliza/trajectories/<agentId>/<trajectoryId>.json`` (overridable via
``ELIZA_STATE_DIR`` / ``ELIZA_STATE_DIR``). LifeOpsBench can ingest
these as evaluation inputs — for example, to score a model on real user
interactions rather than synthetic scenarios.

Hard rule: every trajectory passes through :func:`apply_privacy_filter`
before this module returns it. There is no opt-out. Strict mode
escalates to :class:`UnredactedCredentialError` if any credential
pattern matches; the default mode silently scrubs and continues.
