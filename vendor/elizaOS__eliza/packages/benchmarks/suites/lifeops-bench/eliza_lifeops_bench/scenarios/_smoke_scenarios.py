"""Two smoke scenarios used to exercise the runner end-to-end.

These remain in place for back-compat with the existing
``test_smoke_scenarios_load`` scaffold test, which references the IDs
``smoke_static_calendar_01`` and ``smoke_live_mail_01`` directly. They
also satisfy the manifest-name validity check in
``test_scenarios_corpus.py`` by using real action names from
``manifests/actions.manifest.json``.
