"""Tests that the LIFE_* tool descriptions surfaced to hermes/openclaw are
non-empty and document the wire shape the executor actually accepts.

P0-6 (LifeOps benchmark synthesis plan, 2026-05-11): the planner was guessing
at LIFE_CREATE kwargs because the description was generic, so reminders/sleep
write scenarios scored 0 on action match. These tests pin the documented
fields against the real `_u_life_*` handler shape.
