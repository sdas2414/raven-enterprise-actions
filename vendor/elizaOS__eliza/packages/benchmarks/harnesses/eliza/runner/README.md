# @elizaos/benchmark-eliza-host

Shared HTTP benchmark host: runtime composition, sessions, model routing,
and evidence capture for suite runners. The LifeOps simulated backend is owned
by @elizaos/lifeops-bench. Runs against an
elizaOS checkout (ELIZA_REPO_DIR); never published.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/benchmarks/harnesses/eliza/runner typecheck  # typecheck
bun run --cwd packages/benchmarks/harnesses/eliza/runner test   # tests
```

Run the harness with `bun run --cwd packages/benchmarks/harnesses/eliza/runner benchmark:server`. Live runs require the suite’s configured models, credentials, or hardware; offline tests do not establish a benchmark score.

The server probes text embedding generation at startup. Health and turn receipts include its availability or failure; a dimension-only initialization vector does not establish availability. Cerebras requires a separate real embedding endpoint or local provider. Explicit chat-only and diagnostic stand-in modes skip the probe. An available vector generator does not establish retrieval quality; memory benchmarks must verify recall separately.
