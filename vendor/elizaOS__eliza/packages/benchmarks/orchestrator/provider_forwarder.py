"""Loopback forwarder that keeps remote OpenAI-compatible cohorts publishable.

The hermes and openclaw native runtimes fail closed unless their model
endpoint is a loopback URL, so a cohort pointed at a remote OpenAI-compatible
upstream (an operator-exported ``CEREBRAS_BASE_URL`` / ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``
proxy such as the Eliza Cloud gateway) could previously only run as a
nonpublishable diagnostic. This forwarder restores publishability honestly:
it binds ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1`` (satisfying openclaw's strict
``http://127.0.0.1:`` prefix check and hermes's loopback predicate),
authenticates each harness lane with its own ephemeral bearer token, and
relays ``/v1/chat/completions``, ``/v1/embeddings``, and ``/v1/models`` to the
real upstream with the real credential attached only inside the coordinator
process — byte-for-byte except for the streaming adaptation below. Harness
legs therefore hold no real credential, and their traffic genuinely traverses
loopback.

Chat-completion streaming is de-streamed by default rather than piped raw. The
deployed elizacloud proxy duplicates streamed tool-call arguments — it emits
the incremental argument deltas AND re-serializes the full arguments in its
consolidated chunk, so the spec-mandated per-index concatenation on the client
yields invalid JSON — while its ``stream:false`` responses are correct (fixed
by PR #16973, but production deploys through reviewer-gated ``main``). So when
a harness sends ``"stream": true``, the forwarder rewrites the upstream request
to ``"stream": false``, waits for the complete JSON completion, and synthesizes
a spec-compliant OpenAI SSE stream downstream — the same "SSE is a response
adapter over the same completed query" design the claude-subscription gateway
uses (``harnesses/transports/claude-subscription-gateway/src/server.ts``), and
its chunk sequence is mirrored here: role chunk, content delta, one indexed
tool-call delta per call with the arguments emitted exactly once, finish
chunk, usage chunk, ``[DONE]``. This also makes forwarded runs
transport-deterministic. ``ELIZA_FORWARDER_PASSTHROUGH_STREAMING=1`` restores
raw streaming passthrough once the cloud fix deploys.

The cohort coordinator owns the lifecycle — one forwarder per cohort, fresh
tokens each cohort, closed in the coordinator ``finally`` where a premature
death durably fails the group. Upstream errors pass through as HTTP errors:
the forwarder never fabricates a completion, never retries into a different
endpoint, and never falls back to handing a harness the upstream URL. Neither
the upstream key nor a lane token is ever logged or persisted; the on-disk
evidence carries only the upstream host and per-lane request counts, and is
deliberately not attached to run metrics so it can never enter the
subscription-gateway audit validators.
