 * Additive, NON-mutating alias-aware env reader (arch-audit #12251).
 *
 * Resolves an env value for `key` by consulting the brand<->eliza alias table
 * WITHOUT writing anything to `process.env`. The requested key wins when it is
 * present (non-empty); a blank/whitespace value is treated as absent so a real
 * alias partner still surfaces. If the key is absent, the first present alias
 * partner (in alias-table order) is returned. This is the sole brand<->eliza
 * env-resolution path: it replaced the old `process.env` alias-sync mutation
 * (#13423), so a `<PREFIX>_*` value resolves for either name with nothing ever
 * written back to the environment.
 *
 * @param key       the env key a caller wants to read
 * @param aliases   alias pair table; defaults to the immutable BootConfig list
 * @param env       env source; defaults to the live `process.env`
 * @returns the resolved value, or `undefined` when neither key nor an alias
 *          partner is present
