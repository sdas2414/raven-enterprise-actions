# @elizaos/cloud-sdk

TypeScript SDK for the Eliza Cloud API: auth, agent management, inference, billing,
containers, and typed public-route access.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/cloud/sdk build  # build
bun run --cwd packages/cloud/sdk test  # keyless unit and transport tests
bun run --cwd packages/cloud/sdk test:e2e  # live integration tests
```

Live tests use the configured Cloud endpoints. Set `ELIZAOS_CLOUD_API_KEY` for authenticated API checks and `ELIZA_CLOUD_SESSION_TOKEN` for session checks; tests without their credentials skip. Write/generation/container checks require separate explicit opt-in flags in `src/live.e2e.test.ts`.

## Native Cloud service composition

`@elizaos/cloud-sdk/native-host` is a Node source entrypoint for
verified native gateway payloads. It shares private credential persistence,
account epochs, Cloud login/billing transport, speech framing, account-bound
Google reads and document-runtime authority/provenance checks. It does not
provision a remote agent or expose account API credentials to the renderer.
The checkout projection intentionally returns only provider-scoped payment UI
fields. The document loader requires the host to supply the reviewed source commit and
canvasVersion explicitly; artifact provenance must match both.

Hosts supply explicit `hostPolicy` functions (projectAccountAccess,
createNativeCloudAuth, requireNonSensitiveText, pickMessage, fundingError),
planKeys, planCurrency, planInterval, speechLanguage, multipartPrefix and presentation
messages, plus speechVoice. These are trusted host settings, never renderer
input. The host remains responsible for origin admission and authenticating
requests before this route handler. Native enrollment keeps its own registered
application identity. Document runtimes are reviewed host-owned artifacts.

This Node source entrypoint is separate from the browser-safe root SDK. Run `bun run --cwd packages/cloud/sdk test:native-host` for transport and
private-file tests with synthetic provider responses. Consumer tests cover
product voice, privacy, account races and installed payload dependency closure.

Native `POST /cloud/account/plan-change/{review,confirm,status,pending,payment}`
uses that same private billing authority and account epoch. Review/confirmation
select upgrade or downgrade; payment continuation is only for the original upgrade
invoice. Host plan keys/currency constrain projection; the current review contract
supports monthly plans. Confirmation keys derive from original quote and action,
while status/discovery never dispatch confirmation. Pending pages retain lease and
source state. Hosted invoice links are temporary private payment UI responses:
do not persist, log or add them to agent/model context. Returning from payment
requires fresh command/subscription observation, not a success-URL assumption.

Native `GET /cloud/account/invoices/:id` exposes a read-only account-bound invoice
projection, with no query parameters. The Cloud API owns organization authorization;
the native host rejects mismatched IDs, invalid currency, imprecise or unsafe amounts,
and invalid dates. Fractional-currency numbers above a conservative precision
ceiling are rejected because a legacy API may already have rounded them; decimal
strings preserve the full safe minor-unit range. Private provider IDs and metadata are omitted. Approved Stripe
invoice/PDF links are private ephemeral UI data: do not log, persist or include them
in agent context. Unsupported links become null. Optional fee lines appear only for
paid USD auto-top-up receipts whose exact sum equals both due and paid totals;
malformed optional lines do not suppress valid invoice facts. Hosts own presentation
and explicit link opening. This route does not pay an invoice or change allowances.

Service-only consumers set `hostPolicy.accountBilling: false` to exclude billing
routes. Enrollment requires its factory when a pending credential store is supplied.
Explicit `providerDefaultVoice: true` permits omitted voice IDs; `speechLanguage: null`
uses provider language detection. Omitting these choices retains policy validation.

Use `@elizaos/cloud-sdk/testing` for deterministic setup-session mocks. The older
setup-session mock exports remain compatible; the client root does not load them.

Organization cancellation reversal can use `readOrganizationSubscriptionRenewalReview`
and `submitReviewedOrganizationSubscriptionCancellationUndo` with the returned
terms digest. These require the current billing-manager session. Display the
estimate and obtain explicit confirmation; on an unknown outcome use
`readOrganizationSubscriptionCancellationUndo` instead of inventing another intent.
The review is short-lived and does not lock a future invoice price.

Native billing also exposes management and portal projections, cancellation,
pending/status recovery and reviewed reversal. The local POST
`/cloud/account/subscription/renewal-review` accepts subscriptionId and revision;
`/cloud/account/subscription/undo` additionally requires expectedRenewalTermsDigest.
Hosts must display the complete renewal estimate and obtain explicit approval.
Undo calls the reviewed confirmation API, never legacy unreviewed undo. Its
idempotency identity includes approved terms and survives native restarts. A
same-terms retry requires a matching FAILED predecessor via retryOf; changed
terms require a fresh review and explicit confirmation. Recovery reads never
redispatch. Server-side pending exclusion and billing authority remain decisive.

Native account-factor transport exposes POST `/cloud/account/methods`,
`/methods/unlink`, `/methods/phone/start`, `/methods/phone/verify`, and
`/cloud/account/security/{status,start,verify,enroll/start,enroll/verify}` (method suffixes are relative to
`/cloud/account`). The composed Auth host owns input validation, recent MFA,
private session replacement, collision protection and cancellation. These routes
are unavailable to service-only hosts. They do not manage Gmail consent.


`createOrganizationSubscriptionUpgradeQuote` sends a current manager's catalog
intent to the organization upgrade review endpoint. The returned quote separates
due-now terms from a recurring estimate and expires after at most 60 seconds.
It does not authorize or execute a charge; the internal provider identities and
persistence digests are not part of the public DTO.

Use `confirmOrganizationSubscriptionUpgrade` with the saved `quoteId` and a stable
idempotency key, then `readOrganizationSubscriptionUpgrade` for durable status.
Repeated confirmation reconciles the original effect; status reads never dispatch.
An unknown outcome is pending, not permission to create another payment or quote.
These methods require a current organization billing-manager session.

`continueOrganizationSubscriptionUpgradePayment(commandId)` retrieves a fresh
original-invoice continuation or reconciled command status. Treat its URL as
private ephemeral payment UI data; never persist or log it. Call again after the
provider UI returns and use the durable command result to determine completion.

`createOrganizationSubscriptionDowngradeQuote` reviews a lower catalog plan at
the existing period end. The quote expires within 60 seconds and reports no
immediate charge plus a long-term recurring estimate. Saving it does not schedule
a downgrade; do not show the plan as changed or scheduled after this call.


Use `confirmOrganizationSubscriptionDowngrade` only after displaying the original
lower-plan quote and receiving confirmation. Retain its quote/idempotency identity
across uncertain transport outcomes. `readOrganizationSubscriptionDowngrade` is a
provider-free status read; OUTCOME_UNKNOWN does not authorize a replacement quote
or charge. APPLIED means the lower plan is scheduled; renewal payment still owns
plan/allowance advancement. These session-authenticated methods preserve typed
transport errors and do not put provider receipt/request payloads in the response.

Native management projects the validated pending plan for host presentation without
changing cancellation eligibility. Hosts can explain a scheduled change and prevent
duplicate reviews while leaving current paid-plan authority intact.

Native speech requests forward validated speed, previous/next text and normalization
controls, applying the host's sensitive-text policy to each context string. Voice
identity remains host-owned. The audio JSON includes `renderedSpeed` only as an
acknowledged numeric speed (otherwise null); clients must retain their local pace
adjustment when an older Cloud deployment omits the acknowledgement. A mismatched
or malformed acknowledgement rejects the audio instead of applying pace twice.


Native progressive speech uses three JSON POST routes under `/voice/tts/stream`:
`start` accepts a stable `requestId` (16–128 ASCII letters, digits, underscores or
hyphens) plus the existing text/rendering controls; it returns `streamId`, state
and acknowledged `renderedSpeed`. `pull` accepts that streamId and a zero-based
cursor, returning `{cursor, frame}`. Increment the cursor only after consuming its
frame; retrying the same cursor replays the last result. Audio frames carry MP3
base64, sequence and original/normalized character timing; only the explicit
`done` frame confirms completion. Preserve provider timing coordinates; do not
infer word times from text length. Legacy MP3 responses have null timing and use
the original request, without a second synthesis.

`cancel` accepts either streamId or requestId. Cancelling by requestId before start
creates a tombstone, so an overtaken start cannot synthesize. Hosts should route
cancel independently of a blocked pull. Account changes invalidate all delivery.
Call the returned route handler's `closeSpeechStreams()` when shutting down a
host. Streams are private in-memory sessions, not persistent playback jobs:
request replay protection lasts at most ten minutes and ends on host restart.
Never automatically restart an uncertain synthesis under a new request identity.
Two active streams and 32 retained identities bound host resources; capacity
rejection is explicit. Clients must stop playback on cancellation/account change
and discard unfinished media; this transport alone does not implement playback.

`@elizaos/cloud-sdk/native-speech-stream` is the browser-safe counterpart to the
native session routes. Inject the host's authenticated JSON transport into
`createNativeSpeechStream`, call `open`/`pull`, and retain the same instance when
explicitly retrying a lost transport reply. Its request identity and cursor do not
change on transport failure; malformed protocol data stops the session. Concurrent
pulls share one delivery. A ten-minute client deadline prevents an expired host
identity from accidentally starting a new synthesis. Pass an account/playback
AbortSignal, or call `cancel` on Stop. Never persist the instance or media. The
client exposes separate original/normalized timing without synthesizing offsets.
