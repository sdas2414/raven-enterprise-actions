/**
 * Credit-denominated markup arithmetic for monetized routes.
 *
 * Used by user-MCP proxying, agent MCP, and agent A2A endpoints to compute
 * the credit fee breakdown applied on top of a base cost. The math is
 * unit-agnostic — callers pass either credits or USD as `baseCredits`; the
 * function returns the same unit on every field of the breakdown.
 *
 * The formula:
 *
 *   markupCredits      = baseCredits * (markupPercent / 100)
 *   platformFeeCredits = baseCredits * platformFeeRate
 *   totalCredits       = baseCredits + markupCredits + platformFeeCredits
 *
 * `markupPercent` is the creator / affiliate markup expressed as a percentage
 * (0..`MAX_MARKUP_PERCENT`). `platformFeeRate` is the platform's cut expressed
 * as a fraction (0..1) and defaults to `0` so routes that only charge a creator
 * markup do not accidentally pick up a platform fee. The MCP-proxy affiliate
 * flow opts in by passing `platformFeeRate: DEFAULT_PLATFORM_FEE_RATE`.
