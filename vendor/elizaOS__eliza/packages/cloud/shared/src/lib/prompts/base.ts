## CRITICAL: Complete Every Task
You MUST finish what you start. Writing helper files (types, utils, components) without updating page.tsx is a FAILURE. The user sees the preview live - if page.tsx doesn't render your work, they see nothing.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router, src/app/)
- TypeScript, React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4

## Eliza Cloud Capabilities
- AI chat (streaming and non-streaming)
- Image generation
- Video generation
- Text-to-speech
- Embeddings
- AI agent chat
- User authentication
- Credits and billing
- File uploads
- Analytics
