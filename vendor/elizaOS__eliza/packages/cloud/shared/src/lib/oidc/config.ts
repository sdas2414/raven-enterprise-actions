/**
 * Deployment configuration for the OpenID Connect provider: the issuer string,
 * the endpoint paths derived from it, and the kill switch.
 *
 * The issuer is read VERBATIM from `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` and never derived from the
 * request `Host`. Two consumers make that load-bearing: Merge Steward hard-fails
 * unless the discovery document's `issuer` byte-equals its configured issuer,
 * and the Worker answers `*.elizacloud.ai/*` — including user-content hosts —
 * so a Host-derived issuer would let every subdomain advertise itself as a
 * valid OpenID Provider. Every endpoint therefore also runs `isIssuerHost`
 * and 404s elsewhere.
 *
 * The issuer must be a bare ORIGIN. Every endpoint below is a root-absolute
 * path concatenated onto it, and the Worker really does serve them from the
 * host root, so an issuer carrying a path would advertise URLs that 404 — and
 * `https://api.example/oidc` + `/.well-known/openid-configuration` is not where
 * an RP looks for the document either. Rejecting it is the only honest answer;
 * `validateOidcIssuer` returns the reason so the operator reads a sentence
 * naming the constraint instead of a bare 503.
 *
 * `http` is accepted for LOOPBACK hosts so the provider can be run locally, on
 * `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]`. Point it at the origin the BROWSER
 * reaches the Worker on and build the console with the same string as
 * `VITE_OIDC_ISSUER_URL`: the SPA sends the signed-out login bounce to the
 * issuer origin, and the two loopback names are separate cookie jars, so a
 * local deployment that mixes them drops the session on the way to `/authorize`.
 *
 * The wallet-email domain is derived from the same already-validated URL, which
 * is why it is resolved here rather than read independently: an address minted
 * on a domain the issuer does not own would be registerable by somebody else. An
 * `OIDC_WALLET_EMAIL_DOMAIN` that is SET BUT INVALID does NOT collapse the
 * config, because that failure is not proportional to its blast radius: the
 * variable is optional and governs one opt-in feature, while a null config 404s
 * discovery and 503s authorize, token, and userinfo for every relying party. The
 * feature degrades to unavailable — `walletEmailDomain: null`, the same state an
 * IP-literal issuer produces — and the violated rule is carried on
 * `walletEmailUnavailableReason` and reported by
 * `describeOidcWalletEmailFailure` so it is a named sentence in a log rather
 * than a silent refusal.
