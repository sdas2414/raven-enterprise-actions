/**
 * Shared runtime — runs a single agent turn container-free.
 *
 * This is the generalization of `eliza-app/onboarding-chat.ts` (which already
 * runs the onboarding persona via hosted Cerebras inference with no sandbox)
 * into a reusable primitive that runs ANY simple agent's character. It is the
 * execution engine for Tier 0 ("shared") agents — the default for plain
 * chat / webhook / cron agents that don't need a dedicated container.
 *
 * Model routing: the turn goes through the SAME canonical `getLanguageModel`
 * router as every other inference path in cloud — bare Cerebras ids
 * (`gemma-4-31b`, `gpt-oss-120b`, `zai-glm-4.7`) go straight to Cerebras, every other id goes
 * through BitRouter. There is deliberately NO bespoke provider client here, so a
 * shared agent supports exactly the models the platform does and can never
 * diverge from the proven `/api/v1/chat/completions` path.
 *
 * Caller responsibilities (kept out of here so this stays pure + testable):
 *  - load the agent's character + prior history (from DB/cache)
 *  - persist the returned history (memory) after the turn
 *  - route only shared-eligible agents here (see `agent-tier.ts`)

 * default route with NO cross-provider fallback (`withRateLimitFailFast` only
 * short-circuits 429; 5xx/network keep the SDK's retry). The AI SDK's default
 * exponential backoff is `initialDelayInMs=2000, backoffFactor=2`, so a single
 * transient Cerebras 5xx/network blip costs +2s (1 retry) or +6s (2 retries)
 * of pure sleep BEFORE the turn can succeed or surface. That is the exact
 * bimodal 5-10s warm-stall signature measured on staging (fast turns ~1s;
 * stalled turns ~5s single-retry / ~7-9s double-retry) — a promotion blocker.
 *
 * COLD-PATH stall-B fix (COLDPATH-FIX-2026-07-21): the default is now ZERO.
 * #16713 capped the SDK retry at ONE, which still cost a ~2s `initialDelayInMs`
 * SLEEP that then retried the SAME dead Cerebras upstream. The interactive turn
 * now routes through `getInteractiveCerebrasLanguageModel`, whose middleware
 * fails over to OpenRouter IMMEDIATELY (no backoff) on a transient 5xx/network
 * error — so the SDK's sleeping retry is redundant and, worse, additive. With
 * `maxRetries: 0` a transient blip costs one instant cross-provider failover
 * instead of a 2s–6s sleep, and a hard failure surfaces fast to the refund path.
 * Still tunable via `SHARED_TURN_MAX_RETRIES` for ops without a redeploy;
 * clamped to [0, 2] so it can never re-introduce the SDK default it bounds.
 * Ops can raise it, but the healthy default keeps zero SDK backoff on the
 * interactive path since the failover wrapper owns resilience now.
