/**
 * Matches network-level error messages that mean "the node hosting the

 * sockets, DNS failure, and the SSH connection-establishment timeout. Used by
 * `DockerSandboxProvider.stop()` to treat an unreachable-node delete as
 * TERMINAL ("container gone") rather than a retryable failure: re-queuing such
 * a delete re-runs the ~20-65s stop path every cycle and can push the work
 * cycle past the 300s watchdog, withholding the liveness heartbeat so the
 * cloud-api fails closed and the agents API hangs.
 *
 * Kept deliberately NARROW (connect-phase network tokens only) so it never
 * swallows a legitimate Docker-daemon error — do NOT add generic words like
 * "error".
 *
 * IMPORTANT: we deliberately do NOT match a bare "timeout"/"timed out". The
 * docker-ssh PER-COMMAND timeout ("[docker-ssh] Command timed out after Nms on
 * <host>: ...") fires on a REACHABLE-but-slow node (Docker daemon hung/
 * overloaded, container ignoring SIGTERM, disk-I/O stall, mid-image-pull) where
 * the SSH channel already opened fine. Matching bare "timed out" would
 * mis-classify that live-but-slow node as unreachable and terminally delete a
 * container that is still running. We therefore only match the CONNECT-timeout
 * phrasing — "connection to <host>:<port> timed out" (docker-ssh
 * CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS) — which is a true connect-phase failure; a per-command
 * "Command timed out" is left as a retryable daemon error.
