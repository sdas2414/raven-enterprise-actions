/**
 * Apps ingress route builders (Apps / Product 2) — pure construction of the

 * to an app's container on its node.
 *
 * The front door: stock Caddy on the app node terminates TLS (on-demand, gated
 * by an `ask` endpoint) and routes each per-app hostname to that container's
 * published host port. Caddy is CO-LOCATED on the same app node, and the
 * container publishes only to `127.0.0.1:hostPort` (never `0.0.0.0`), so the
 * upstream dial is the node loopback — the port is unreachable across the
 * shared private network, which closes a cross-tenant ingress bypass. Routes
 * are managed LIVE via Caddy's admin API — the
 * daemon POSTs a route right after the container is marked running and DELETEs it
 * (by `@id`) on teardown — so adding/removing one app never reloads the others.
 *
 * Pure + IO-free, so the wire format is a unit-testable contract; the actual
 * HTTP calls live in `apps-ingress-provisioner`.
