/**
 * Suffixes of keys a caller must never place in a managed agent's container.
 * Each one hands caller-supplied input to something that then runs, or fetches
 * and then runs, code inside the container:
 *
 * - `TERMINAL_RUN_TOKEN` is what the terminal action reads from its own
 *   environment and replays as the token authorising the call, so it
 *   authenticates to itself. The platform never sets it; its absence IS the
 *   gate, which is why a caller who can set it opens command execution.
 * - the skills keys resolve where a skill is downloaded from and which
 *   directories are loaded without an install scan. Repointing one turns
 *   "install a skill" into "fetch and run caller-supplied code", and the
 *   scanner only reads JS/TS content, so a `.py` or `.sh` payload is executed
 *   having never been opened.
 *
 * Matched by suffix rather than exact name on purpose. `readAliasedEnv`
 * resolves a brand partner for every `ELIZA_*` key
 * (packages/core/src/config/brand-env-aliases.ts carries
 * `TERMINAL_RUN_TOKEN`), and the brand prefix is deployment-configurable, so
 * `ELIZA_TERMINAL_RUN_TOKEN` and `<PREFIX>_TERMINAL_RUN_TOKEN` are the same
 * switch to the runtime. Pinning one spelling would leave the partner open.
 *
 * Removed here, rather than denied on the write routes, because a denylist on
 * those routes cannot hold: the stored `environment_vars` row is replayed
 * verbatim on every provision, restart and blue/green upgrade without
 * consulting one, and several create surfaces accept `environmentVars` with no
 * denylist at all. This function is the point every one of those paths funnels
 * through — the same reason ELIZA_CLOUD_PAIR_DIRECT_RELAY is stamped below
 * rather than merely reserved.
