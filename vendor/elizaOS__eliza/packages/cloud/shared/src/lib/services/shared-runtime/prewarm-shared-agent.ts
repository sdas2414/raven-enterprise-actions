/**
 * Provision-time cache prewarm for shared-runtime agents (CHAT-CORE-LATENCY §6
 * item 1: move hydration from "first paying request" to "agent create").
 *
 * A fresh shared agent's FIRST turn is served entirely from caches
 * (fail-closed, cache-only by design): conversation history (Durable Object),
 * the combined inference-admission snapshot (org balance + rate tier), model
 * pricing rates, and the linked character projection. None of those entries
 * exist for a brand-new agent/org, so the first send bounces off 2-4 retryable
 * 503s ("Conversation cache is warming. Retry shortly.", "Billing
 * authorization is warming. Retry shortly.") before the first 200 — measured
 * 13-27s of client-visible first-message wall on staging across 14/14 fresh
 * agents (QA-MATRIX-2026-08-11 §2/§3, FIRSTFIVE-CLOSE-2026-08-12). Clients
 * that do not retry the retryable 503 surface a broken first message at the
 * exact worst moment of the funnel.
 *
 * This runs the SAME authoritative hydration the 503 path already schedules
 * under waitUntil — just at create time, seconds before a human can type. By
 * the first message every gate the turn consults is warm.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: legs are independent and a failure only means the
 * first turn falls back to today's retryable-503 warming behavior — this can
 * only remove latency, never change an authorization or billing outcome.
 * Callers must keep it off the response path (Worker executionCtx.waitUntil).
