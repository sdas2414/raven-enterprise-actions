/**
 * `RateLimitGovernor` — a deterministic, clock-injected throttle for the
 * DigitalOcean v2 REST API droplet-create path, plus `pollAction`, the
 * WaitForActive poll loop the async provider primitive is built on.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The DO API enforces three independent limits the control plane can trip
 * during a burst of droplet provisioning:
 *
 *   - **≤ 250 requests / minute** (account-wide rolling window)
 *   - **≤ 5000 requests / hour** (account-wide rolling window)
 *   - **≤ 10 concurrent droplet creates** in flight
 *
 * The first two are *rates* — capacity returns as time passes. The third is a
 * *semaphore* — capacity returns only when an in-flight create finishes. They
 * are modelled differently on purpose: rates are lazy-refill token buckets;
 * concurrency is an explicit waiter queue woken by `release()`.
 *
 * The governor makes **no HTTP calls itself**. The caller drives it: `acquire()`
 * before starting a create, `release()` when the create settles, and
 * `observeHeaders()` / `note429()` after each response so the governor can
 * self-correct against the server's own `ratelimit-remaining` / `ratelimit-reset`
 * headers (the server is the source of truth — local buckets drift because the
 * account-wide budget is also consumed by calls that never went through this
 * governor).
 *
 * ## Determinism
 *
 * Every wait routes through an injected {@link Clock} (`now()` + `sleep()`); the
 * logic path contains no `Date.now`, no real `setTimeout`, and no `Math.random`.
 * Backoff is a pure `base * 2^attempt` schedule (no jitter) so a `ManualClock`
 * in the test reproduces every timing exactly.
 */
