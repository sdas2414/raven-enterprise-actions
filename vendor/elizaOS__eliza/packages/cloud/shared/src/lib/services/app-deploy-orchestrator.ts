/**
 * App deploy orchestration (Apps / Product 2) — turns a deploy request into a

 * row carrying that DSN, enqueue a CONTAINER_PROVISION job, and link the
 * container to the app. This is what replaces the `/v1/apps/:id/deploy` stub
 * (which only flipped status='building').
 *
 * Every side is an injected seam, so the flow is unit-testable with fakes and
 * stays decoupled from 2AM's `containers` schema/repo (createContainerRow is
 * injected). The load-bearing property — the app container gets its OWN DSN, not
 * the shared agent DATABASE_URL — is asserted as a unit test.
