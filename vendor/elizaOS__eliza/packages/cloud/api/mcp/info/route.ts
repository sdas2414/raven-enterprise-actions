/**
 * GET /api/mcp/info
 *
 * Metadata endpoint for the Eliza Cloud MCP server: the advertised tool
 * inventory, pricing posture, and authentication requirements.
 *
 * The inventory is DERIVED from the platform tool registry
 * (`listPlatformCloudMcpTools`) — the same source the JSON-RPC `tools/list`
 * handler and the `tools/call` dispatcher execute — so a planner reading this
 * document can never see a tool the server would fail to run. This endpoint is
 * unauthenticated and requires no DB or env access.
