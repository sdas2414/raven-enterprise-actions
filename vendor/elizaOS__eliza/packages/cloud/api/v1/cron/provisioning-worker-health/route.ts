/**
 * /api/v1/cron/provisioning-worker-health
 * Cron job that observes the provisioning-worker daemon heartbeat and, when it
 * is stale/absent, alerts ops (structured error log + configured channels).
 * The daemon cannot page about its own death, so this runs separately on the
 * Worker. Schedule: every minute (registered in CRON_FANOUT for "* * * * *"
 * alongside health-check and deployment-monitor).
 *
 * Also runs the dedicated-fleet liveness monitor (#22548): "dedicated agents
 * exist and none is serving" is invisible to the heartbeat sweep (which
 * iterates only running rows), so this cron asks it explicitly and publishes
 * provisioning success measured on the jobs ledger in its response and logs.
 * The root `healthy` signal covers both monitors; `heartbeatHealthy` preserves
 * the daemon-only signal for diagnosis.
 *
 * The two monitors are INDEPENDENT questions that merely share a schedule, so
 * they are settled independently: a Redis outage in the heartbeat gate, or a
 * database outage in the fleet census, must not silence the sibling monitor —
 * that would recreate the exact silence this cron exists to prevent, at the
 * exact moment one monitoring dependency is unhealthy. Each failure is logged
 * under its own scope and the cron still answers with a structured failure so
 * the schedule itself is visibly red.
 *
 * Protected by CRON_SECRET; supports GET (Workers cron trigger) and POST (manual hits).
