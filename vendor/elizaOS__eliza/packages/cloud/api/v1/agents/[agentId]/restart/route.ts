/**
 * POST /api/v1/agents/[agentId]/restart
 *
 * Service-to-service: enqueue an `agent_restart` job. The orchestrator
 * daemon SSH-stops the existing container and runs a full `provision()`
 * to recreate it (URLs restored from the fresh sandbox handle). Atomic
 * on the daemon side so concurrent restarts can't interleave.
 *
 * Replaces the Worker-side `shutdown()` + `provision()` sequence which
 * silently skipped the stop from CF Workers (no SSH) and could leave
 * the old container running alongside the new one.
 *
 * Optional JSON body `{ "stateLossAcknowledged": true }` (#18228) is the
 * sanctioned operator override for an agent whose pre-stop snapshot capture
 * or transfer persistently fails: the daemon proceeds to stop without a
 * capture, explicitly discarding state since the last durable backup. The
 * waiver is refused (409) rather than silently dropped when a non-waived
 * restart job is already in flight.
