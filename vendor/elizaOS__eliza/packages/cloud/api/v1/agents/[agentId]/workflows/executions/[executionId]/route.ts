/**
 * Workflow proxy: get an execution status + result.
 *
 * GET /api/v1/agents/:agentId/workflows/executions/:executionId
 *   -> agent /api/workflow/executions/:id
 *
 * NOTE — agent-side gap: plugin-workflow's executions routes are defined
 * in src/routes/executions.ts but are NOT mounted in
 * src/plugin-routes.ts. This cloud route forwards anyway and will relay
 * whatever the agent returns (currently 404). Once the plugin mounts the
 * executions surface, this endpoint becomes live with no cloud changes.
