# @elizaos/cloud-api

The Eliza Cloud HTTP API: a Cloudflare Workers app (Hono router) that backs auth,
app/agent registration, inference routing, billing, MCP, A2A, domains, and container
deploys.

Runs on Cloudflare Workers with Hono. Start with `bun run --cwd packages/cloud/api dev`;
local bindings are derived from root .env/.env.local. Add routes in the file-based route
tree and run the package codegen script. The build script checks types; typecheck also
validates router and Worker bundling contracts.

## Development

Install dependencies with `bun install` at the repository root. Run from that root:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/cloud/api build  # build
bun run --cwd packages/cloud/api test   # tests
```

## Independent native App Auth clients

`ELIZA_MOBILE_APP_AUTH_CLIENTS_JSON` optionally registers additional native clients.
It is a server-owned JSON array of `{clientId, appId, redirectUri, enabled}` records.
Client IDs, app UUIDs and canonical HTTPS return URLs must be unique, including
against the existing `ai.elizaos.app` registration. Unknown and disabled clients
fail closed; malformed additional configuration does not change the legacy client.
The global mobile-auth enable switch and environment binding still apply.

Before enabling a client, provision its own active, approved app with an active
owner/organization, an exact allowed callback, and no live generated application
API key. Use separate registrations in staging and production. Validate the public
`/api/v1/app-auth/mobile/config` response for that client/environment/return URL
before shipping. The app UUID and server secrets must not be included in the
native configuration. Retain the existing S256 grant, inactive exchange, durable
receipt acknowledgment, self-revocation and account recovery contracts. `cloud:user`
is the existing broad user/organization capability, not a narrower permission claim.

## Pending plan-change discovery

`GET /api/v1/subscriptions/plan-change/commands?limit=...` rediscovers the current
billing manager's own pending upgrade/downgrade commands. Use its opaque cursor
for the next bounded page; it is bound to organization, actor and command family.
Each page is a fresh primary read, not a frozen multi-request snapshot. Discovery
does not claim a lease, contact the payment provider or resume an operation.
The response includes original target, lease state and current-source relationship;
read the corresponding command status or refresh the subscription before acting.
Cancellation/resumption retain the separate `/subscriptions/commands` contract.

## Organization renewal review

`GET /api/v1/subscriptions/cancel/undo/review` accepts `subscriptionId` and a
positive decimal `expectedSubscriptionRevision`. It requires the current billing
manager session and returns a no-store, 60-second renewal estimate for an eligible
scheduled cancellation. The pinned provider invoice preview includes tax, discounts
and customer balance; unsupported or incomplete previews fail closed. It creates
no command, invoice or payment. `termsDigest` compares reviewed terms; it is not an
authorization token or price lock. Use the confirmation route below to persist and revalidate reviewed terms
before a reversal dispatch.

`POST /api/v1/subscriptions/cancel/undo/confirm` requires the subscription ID,
expected lifecycle revision, idempotency key and `expectedRenewalTermsDigest`
from the review. It persists fresh matching terms with the durable command and
revalidates them before dispatch. Reusing the same intent reads its recorded
outcome; it never dispatches again. Changed terms before admission return 409;
a rejection with a still-ready lease becomes FAILED, while a started dispatch
retains OUTCOME_UNKNOWN until observation resolves it. Recovery fails expired
prepared reviews without reconstructing a mutation. The existing undo/status
APIs remain compatible; consumers needing reviewed confirmation use this route.
Apply migration `0510_subscription_renewal_review_receipts` before deploying.


## Organization upgrade review

`POST /api/v1/subscriptions/upgrade/review` accepts `subscriptionId`, a positive
safe-integer `expectedSubscriptionRevision`, and a catalog `targetPlanKey`.
The current billing manager session is required and revalidated after provider
reads. The no-store response contains `quoteId` and `review`, separating due-now
proration/tax/discount/customer-balance terms from a long-term recurring estimate.
The exact reviewed timestamp and prorated additional allowance are retained.
Apply organization-upgrade migrations 0511 through 0520 before deployment.
Saving a quote creates no charge, command or allowance grant. Confirmation and
payment continuation use the separate endpoints below; scheduled downgrade remains
separate lifecycle work.

`POST /api/v1/subscriptions/upgrade/confirm` accepts only `quoteId` and
`idempotencyKey`. It revalidates the current manager and original review before
one dispatch; retries retain the original command. `GET /api/v1/subscriptions/upgrade/:commandId`
reads durable status without provider work. Both return no-store responses and
require a current billing-manager session. `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` can include pending
payment and must not trigger a new intent. `failure: review_required` means an
unstarted review ended; `invoice_void` requires definitive original void evidence.
Product UI/native adoption and real provider acceptance remain separate work.

`POST /api/v1/subscriptions/upgrade/:commandId/payment` reconciles the original
command and returns either durable status or an ephemeral private hosted-invoice
continuation. It checks the original invoice, reviewed amount, pending target and
unpaid payment intent, then revalidates manager/source/session authority. It never
creates or pays an invoice. The no-store URL must stay out of logs, model context
and history. Call again after browser return; return alone does not prove payment.

`POST /api/v1/subscriptions/downgrade/review` uses the same authenticated catalog
intent and returns an immutable lower-plan quote. `effectiveAt` is the current
period end and `amountDueNowCents` is zero. `recurringEstimate` is a long-term
estimate, not a guaranteed next invoice. This endpoint creates no provider
schedule, command, charge or allowance change; downgrade confirmation is not
yet exposed. Upgrade confirmation rejects a downgrade quote.


Organization downgrade confirmation uses `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/downgrade/confirm`
with only `quoteId` and `idempotencyKey` from an explicitly reviewed original quote.
`GET /api/v1/subscriptions/downgrade/{commandId}` reads durable status without
provider work. Both require the current billing-manager session, recheck identity
before returning, and return no-store responses. Confirmation resumes the original
journal; it never repeats a started provider effect. APPLIED records a pending
lower plan, not payment or immediate lower-plan allowance. Missing/changed original
command authority is a conflict, not proof that a replacement intent is safe.
Apply scheduling migrations through 0527 before deployment. Unattended recovery,
configured-schedule undo/cancel/resume, retained-adjustment payment authority and
live qualification remain required before product rollout.

## Speech rendering controls

`POST /api/v1/voice/tts` accepts optional `speed` (0.7–1.2), `previousText` and
`nextText` (at most 5,000 characters each), and `applyTextNormalization`
(`auto`, `on`, `off`) for ElevenLabs synthesis. Explicitly pin an ElevenLabs
voice when the deployment defaults to another provider; unsupported providers
reject these options instead of silently dropping them. Context passes through
content screening, but only the synthesized text is priced. Requests with any
rendering control bypass the legacy audio cache. Explicit normalization takes
precedence over the service's legacy latency optimization. Successful responses
with explicit speed include `X-Eliza-TTS-Speed`, allowing clients to avoid applying
pace twice and detect older deployments. Response audio and
existing authorization, admission and billing boundaries are unchanged.

Set `withTimestamps: true` with an ElevenLabs voice to receive
`application/x-ndjson` and `X-Eliza-TTS-Timing: character-v1`. Timed output is MP3
only and bypasses audio caching. Each `audio` record has a zero-based sequence,
base64 audio, MIME type, original alignment and normalized alignment (nullable).
Alignment arrays retain provider character coordinates; no timing is estimated.
A final `done` record reports frame/audio-byte totals; missing completion means
the stream is incomplete. Consumers must validate timing and bind it to their
playback clock. The adapter bounds audio to 8 MiB, combined alignment to 50,000
characters and records to 2,048; exceeding a limit fails rather than truncates.
Cancellation aborts the provider transport. Provider errors after response headers
error the stream without a completion record; existing synthesis billing semantics
remain unchanged. This endpoint alone does not provide client streaming playback.
