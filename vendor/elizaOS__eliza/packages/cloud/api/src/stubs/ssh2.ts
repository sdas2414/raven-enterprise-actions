/**
 * ssh2 — Cloudflare Workers compatibility shim.
 *
 * The real ssh2 package is Node-only (loads a `.node` native binding).
 * Container/agent SSH operations live on the Node sidecar
 * (`services/agent-server` + Hetzner Docker pool — see cloud/INFRA.md
 * "Long-running services NOT migrated"). The Worker is bundled with this
 * shim so transitive imports don't crash the build; any code path that
 * actually instantiates a Client at runtime throws a clear error so the
 * accidental Worker-side call is visible immediately.
