    1. Confirm tenant_db_admin_dsn from ../apps-shared has been seeded into
       tenant_db_clusters (provider='direct_pg', host=tenant_db_private_ip).
    2. Set the daemon/Worker apps env: CONTAINERS_DOCKER_NODES (app_node_ips),
       CONTAINERS_PUBLIC_BASE_DOMAIN=${var.apps_base_domain}, the image registry,
       CONTAINERS_EGRESS_PROXY_URL.
    3. Wire the 2 boot one-liners (cloud-api configureAppsDeployTrigger + daemon
       configureAppsDeployBackend) and flip the feature gate for an allowlist.
    4. On-node kernel re-check (throwaway --internal scratch net on an app node)
       before opening to users.
