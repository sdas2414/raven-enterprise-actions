# One-shot adoption of the headscale A record that was created by hand during
# the 2026-06 headscale-on-CP cutover, before cloudflare_dns_record.headscale
# (in main.tf) existed. Without this, the first apply after this PR would try to
# CREATE an A record that already exists. Cloudflare record IDs are not secrets.
#
# Flow: staging imports on the next develop apply, production on the next
# (reviewer-gated) main apply. Post-import the block is a no-op, so it is safe to
# leave; remove this whole file in a follow-up once both envs' state has it.
