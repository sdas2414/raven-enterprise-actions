# Cloud tooling

Private operational and test scripts for Eliza Cloud. The package declares its
workspace imports locally so they do not invalidate unrelated build caches.
Invoke operations through their documented root commands; run the script test
lane with `bun run test:scripts` from the repository root.

Gateway deployment, verification, homepage readiness, and DNS operations belong
here. Invoke them with `bun run --cwd packages/cloud/scripts sms-gateway:verify:cloud-prod`
or the corresponding `sms-gateway:*` command in this package. Device installation
and pairing remain in the app package.
