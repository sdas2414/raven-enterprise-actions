// Attestation-bound sealed state-volume mount hook (plan §3.5a; OS half of the
// agent ↔ OS sealed-volume contract).
//
// The dm-crypt/LUKS2 state volume that backs ELIZA_STATE_DIR (the
// agent-session secret scope) must NOT be unlocked with a host-readable key
// (dstack LUKS2 advisory GHSA-jxq2-hpw3-m5wf; agent plan §5.5). Its key is
// released ONLY after a passing attestation and is bound to the measured
// agent/policy/device identity. A tampered OS/agent derives a DIFFERENT key,
// the volume simply will not decrypt, and the negative path is enforced by
// data unavailability — not by a flag that can be patched out.
//
// SCOPE (OS half): this hook obtains the attestation-released volume key
// through the agent contract (unsealStateVolumeKey: a 32-byte hex value gated
// on a passing attestation), then drives `cryptsetup luksOpen` + `mount`. It
// FAILS CLOSED: if the key is withheld (the unseal call throws — boot gate
// blocks secrets, policy does not gate the required measurements, or the
// release decision is not trusted), the hook does NOT open or mount the
// volume, exits non-zero, and never falls back to a host-readable key.
//
// SCOPE (agent half — NOT here): the security-critical attestation→key binding
// lives in packages/agent/src/services/tee-sealed-volume.ts
// (`unsealStateVolumeKey` / `openSealedVolumeMetadata`). This hook integrates
// with it through an injected `unsealKey` function so the fail-closed mount
// logic is unit-testable in memory without hardware.
//
// HARDWARE BOUNDARY (fail-closed): a real dm-crypt unlock requires the
// confidential guest (TDX CVM / E1 CoVE TVM) where the attested key is actually
// released — that is BLOCKED on hardware (plan OS-6/OS-8). What is tested here
// is the key-binding + fail-closed mount logic: on a released key the hook
// invokes cryptsetup with the key piped on stdin; on a withheld key it makes NO
// cryptsetup call at all. Pass an injected `runCryptsetup` (or `--dry-run`) to
// exercise the logic off-hardware.

 * Drive the sealed-volume mount. Returns the mapper path on success; THROWS

 *
 * @param {object} config
 * @param {() => Promise<{ keyMaterialHex: string }>} config.unsealKey
 *   The agent contract boundary. Resolves to the attestation-released 32-byte
 *   (hex) volume key, or REJECTS when the key is withheld (boot gate blocks
 *   secrets / policy does not gate required measurements / decision not
 *   trusted). Mirrors packages/agent/src/services/tee-sealed-volume.ts
 *   `unsealStateVolumeKey`. Injected so this hook is host-testable.
 * @param {string} config.cryptDevice
 *   Backing block device holding the LUKS2 state volume (e.g. /dev/vdb).
 * @param {string} config.mapperName
 *   dm-crypt mapping name; the unlocked device appears at /dev/mapper/<name>.
 * @param {string} config.mountPoint
 *   Where the unlocked volume is mounted (ELIZA_STATE_DIR).
 * @param {(args: { command: string, args: string[], keyMaterialHex: string }) => Promise<void>} [config.runCryptsetup]
 *   Injected runner for the privileged cryptsetup/mount commands. Defaults to a
 *   real spawn that pipes the key on stdin. Tests inject a recorder so no real
 *   device is touched.
