# elizaOS lunch targets.
#
# Cuttlefish: virtual phones. arm64, x86_64, and riscv64 are all declared so
#   the elizaOS AOSP fork has explicit emulator lanes for each supported ABI.
#   riscv64 boot transcripts are gated on a Linux x86_64 build host. External
#   chip simulators require their own pinned product and source lock.
# Pixel hardware: each device has its own pinned source/stock-input contract.
# GSI: system-only images for third-party Treble devices, built from the
#   gsi-android17 (cp2a) source profile. No GSI target is installer-eligible.
# Installer eligibility remains independently gated by hardware-targets.json
# and a retained real-device flash/boot evidence bundle.
