/**
 * Run a command once, and once more only when it fails with a known
 * infrastructure flake signature in its output. Exists for suites whose real
 * failures must stay loud while a named runner-level fault (e.g. Bun's
 * subprocess stdio wiring emitting `EEXIST … epoll_ctl` / `Failed to connect`
 * between tests) gets one bounded second chance. A failure that does not
 * match the signature is never retried.
 * Exit codes: the final attempt's own code, 127 when the command cannot
 * start, 2 on usage errors.
 *
 * usage: node packages/scripts/run-with-flake-retry.ts <signature-regex> -- <command> [args...]
