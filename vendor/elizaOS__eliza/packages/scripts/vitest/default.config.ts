/**
 * Test naming convention:
 *
 * *.test.ts            — Unit tests (run by this config / turbo test)
 * *.integration.test.ts — Integration tests (run by integration.config)
 * *.e2e.test.ts        — E2E tests (run by e2e.config)
 * *.real.test.ts       — Real infra tests (run by real.config, needs env vars)
 * *.live.test.ts       — Live tests (run by real.config, needs running services)
 * *.live.e2e.test.ts   — Live E2E (run by live-e2e.config, needs services + env)
 * *.real.e2e.test.ts   — Real E2E (run by e2e.config, needs env vars)
 * *.spec.ts            — Playwright specs (run by playwright configs)
 *
 * Test locations: src/, __tests__/, test/ — all are auto-discovered.
 * Cloud subsystems use their own runners.
