/**
 * Real agent-self-voice rejection + overlapping-speakers — real models (#8785).
 *
 * Answers two explicit asks with real audio + real models:
 *
 *   A) "How do we detect what the AGENT's voice sounds like, and reject it from
 *      going back into TTS?" — synthesize the agent's reply on-device (the real
 *      TTS), embed it with WeSpeaker, and show the agent's voice is (i) a
 *      consistent, recognizable speaker across different replies (self-voice
 *      continuity → an echo guard can match it), and (ii) clearly distinct from
 *      a human user. So `selfVoiceSimilarity` (the gate input we added) is real:
 *      an agent-echo turn matches the agent imprint and is suppressed.
 *
 *   B) Overlapping / interrupting speakers — mix two voices SIMULTANEOUSLY and
 *      confirm the pyannote diarizer flags overlap (powerset pair labels), the
 *      basis for "voices interrupting each other".
 *
 * Human speech: two distinct ElevenLabs voices when ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is set,
 * else a keyless cached corpus from two distinct fused Kokoro voice packs
 * (#9577). The AGENT voice is always the fused Kokoro engine — Kokoro is the
 * only on-device TTS engine, so a Kokoro pack IS the agent's product voice, and
 * unlike the OmniVoice auto-voice path its speaker identity is deterministic
 * across replies (the property part A exists to prove). Inputs (env):
 * ELIZA_INFERENCE_LIBRARY, ELIZA_ASR_BUNDLE, ELIZA_SPEAKER_GGUF,
 * ELIZA_DIARIZ_GGUF, ELIZA_KOKORO_MODEL_DIR, optional ELEVENLABS_API_KEY.
 * Exits 2 (skip) on a missing artifact.
