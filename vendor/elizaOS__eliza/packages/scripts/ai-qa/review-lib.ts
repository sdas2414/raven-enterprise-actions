/**
 * Pure logic for the AI-QA vision screenshot review (#9304).
 *
 * Today the "screenshot review" layer is a color-bucket + blank-detection
 * heuristic — it never looks at what the UI actually shows. This module is the
 * dependency-free core of a real content review: it builds the per-capture
 * vision prompt, parses the model's structured verdict, aggregates the run, and
 * decides the gate. The live model call + filesystem I/O live in
 * `review-screenshots.ts`; everything here is pure so it is unit-tested without
 * a network or an API key.
