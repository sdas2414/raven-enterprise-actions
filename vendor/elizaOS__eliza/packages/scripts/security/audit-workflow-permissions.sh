# audit-workflow-permissions.sh
#
# Adds a top-level `permissions: contents: read` block to every workflow in
# .github/workflows that lacks one. Per-job permissions overrides remain
# untouched. This implements the OpenSSF Scorecard "Token-Permissions" check
# baseline (SOC2 CC6.1 / CC6.8).
#
# Usage:
#   packages/scripts/security/audit-workflow-permissions.sh         # apply
#   packages/scripts/security/audit-workflow-permissions.sh --check # report only
#
# Safe to re-run: skips files that already have a top-level `permissions:`.
