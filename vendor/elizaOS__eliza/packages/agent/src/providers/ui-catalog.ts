export const UI_WIDGETS_GUIDE = `## In-chat widgets — canonical markers you can emit in replies

### [CONFIG:pluginId] — plugin configuration card
Emit EXACTLY this marker whenever a plugin comes up in setup/config/status
(e.g. [CONFIG:discord], [CONFIG:openai]). The UI renders a full configuration
form from the plugin schema; emit the marker instead of prose setup steps.
### [CONNECTOR:pluginId] — compact connect-a-service card
On "connect X": confirm via [CHOICE:connector-add] (Add-it / Not-now), then on
accept emit [CONNECTOR:x] + one closing line ("Tap the card to sign in.").
The card shows icon + description + one Authorize/Add-token button. NEVER ask
for tokens or paste auth links in chat text; the card handles both masked.

### [FOLLOWUPS] — 2–4 tappable next steps (optional)
Use ONLY when a follow-up genuinely helps. Emit INLINE, one
\`<kind>:<payload>=<label>\` per line:
[FOLLOWUPS]
reply:Summarize my unread messages=Summarize unread
navigate:/apps/tasks=View tasks
prompt:Draft a reply about =Draft a reply
[/FOLLOWUPS]
Kinds: reply sends <payload>; navigate opens a "/" route or view id; prompt
prefills the composer. Labels 1–4 words. Omit when no useful next step exists.

### [CHOICE:<scope>] — pick one from concrete options
Use when 2+ explicit choices remove typing or ambiguity. Emit \`<value>=<label>\` per line; tapped value is sent as the user's next message.
Values use the actual option's stable identity; never invent IDs. Labels name each actual option (title plus distinguishing ID when needed), never generic A/B placeholders:
[CHOICE:note-selection id=note-choice-123]
Select note note_123=Travel checklist (note_123)
Select note note_456=Travel checklist (note_456)
[/CHOICE]

### [FORM] — collect several specific values at once
Render a form instead of asking in prose when a tool needs 2+ missing fields.
Emit INLINE; body is one JSON object on its own line between the markers:
[FORM]
{"title":"Schedule reminder","submitLabel":"Create","fields":[{"name":"title","type":"text","label":"Reminder","required":true},{"name":"when","type":"datetime","label":"When","required":true},{"name":"channel","type":"select","label":"Notify via","options":[{"label":"Push","value":"push"},{"label":"Email","value":"email"}]}]}
[/FORM]
Field types: text | number | select (needs options) | checkbox | date | time |
datetime (prefer temporal types for schedules; field names start with a letter).
NEVER use [FORM] for secrets or API keys. For one free-text answer, just ask.

### [CHECKLIST] — live todo list while you work through steps
[CHECKLIST]
{"title":"Migration","items":[{"content":"Back up the database","status":"completed"},{"content":"Run the migration","status":"in_progress"},{"content":"Verify downstream consumers","status":"pending"}]}
[/CHECKLIST]
Item status: pending | in_progress | completed. Re-emit the WHOLE block with
updated statuses. A coding/orchestrator task surfaces its own plan.

### [WORKFLOW] — ordered k/N step pipeline
[WORKFLOW]
{"title":"Deploy","steps":[{"label":"Build image","status":"done"},{"label":"Push to registry","status":"running"},{"label":"Roll out","status":"pending"}]}
[/WORKFLOW]
Step status: pending | running | done | failed. Re-emit to advance. [WORKFLOW]
is ordered; [CHECKLIST] is unordered.

### When to use
- Connect a service → [CONNECTOR:pluginId]; deeper setup/status → [CONFIG:pluginId]
- Pick one → [CHOICE]; several values → [FORM]; next steps → [FOLLOWUPS]
- Your own multi-step work → [CHECKLIST] (unordered) / [WORKFLOW] (ordered)
- Custom dashboards/tables/charts → separate generative-UI guide; facts → text`;

export const UI_WIDGETS_CAPABILITIES = `## In-chat controls
Render requested controls in the final reply during planning/completion. Stage 1 routes presentation-only requests to general with no action candidates, replyEffectStatus="pending", and a brief acknowledgment; it does not author controls. A configuration card is reply markup, not an action: compose its marker through the terminal reply, without tool discovery, connection listing, status reads, navigation or settings changes. Missing domain actions or connections do not establish that the renderer is unavailable. Use the requested plugin identifier; the card handles its own configuration state. For a card-only request, emit only the requested marker. Longer uiWidgets examples are separately available on demand.
Canonical inline syntax:
- Plugin setup/status: [CONFIG:pluginId]. Connect-service confirmation: [CHOICE:connector-add] followed by [CONNECTOR:pluginId] on acceptance. Cards handle credentials; never request secrets or auth links in chat.
- Choices: [CHOICE:scope] then one value=Label per line, then [/CHOICE]. Use actual stable values/IDs and distinct labels; never invent record IDs.
- Optional follow-ups: [FOLLOWUPS] then kind:payload=Label per line, then [/FOLLOWUPS]. Kinds: reply (text), navigate (path), prompt (text).
- Form: [FORM] then one JSON object {"title":"Title","fields":[{"name":"field","type":"text","label":"Label","required":true}]} then [/FORM]. Field types: text, number, select (options), checkbox, date, time, datetime. Use forms for 2+ missing fields; never secrets/API keys.
- Checklist: [CHECKLIST] then {"items":[{"content":"Task","status":"pending"}]} then [/CHECKLIST]. Status: pending, in_progress, completed.
- Workflow: [WORKFLOW] then {"steps":[{"label":"Step","status":"pending"}]} then [/WORKFLOW]. Status: pending, running, done, failed.
Opening/choosing/submitting a control is not proof of a saved change; only tool results establish effects.`;

    const text = `## Generative UI — inline JSONL patches (custom dashboards, tables, visualisations)
Use this ONLY for a custom table, metrics view, dashboard, or visualisation.
Rendering or revising an in-chat visual is a direct reply: contexts=["simple"], replyEffectStatus="none". It needs no APP/VIEWS action and does not navigate or save records.
For plugin setup use [CONFIG:pluginId]; for a quick fixed-field form use
[FORM]; both are described in the in-chat widgets guide — never hand-build
those here.

Each reply is a separate render; it cannot patch a previous reply. For follow-ups, emit the complete updated /root and all referenced /elements again. Nested /elements/id/props paths are unsupported.
Emit these supported JSON patch lines INLINE (no code fences, no markdown):
{"op":"add","path":"/root","value":"card-1"}
{"op":"add","path":"/elements/card-1","value":{"type":"Card","props":{"title":"Weekly report"},"children":["body-1"]}}
{"op":"add","path":"/elements/body-1","value":{"type":"Text","props":{"text":"Numbers below."},"children":[]}}

Table example (complete standalone render):
{"op":"add","path":"/root","value":"comparison"}
{"op":"add","path":"/elements/comparison","value":{"type":"Table","props":{"columns":["Item","Count"],"rows":[["Example","1"]]},"children":[]}}

Rules:
- Always emit /root first, then /elements/<id>, then /state/<key>
- Each patch must be on its own line, valid JSON, no trailing text on that line
- Element IDs: unique kebab-case strings
- state binding: set statePath prop on Input/Select/Textarea to a dot-path key
- data binding in props: "$data.key.path" resolves from state at render time
