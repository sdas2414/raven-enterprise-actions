/**
 * Shell access prober.
 *
 * Shell execution is app-internal — there's no OS permission for spawning
 * child processes. We honor an in-app toggle (managed by the existing
 * `PermissionManager.setShellEnabled` in
 * `packages/app/platforms/electrobun/src/native/permissions.ts`).
 *
 * The default prober reports granted access because shell execution is gated
 * elsewhere by the runtime's shell router and app-internal configuration. A
 * registry-provided prober can replace this one when a host wants permission
 * status to mirror a user-toggled `shellEnabled` flag.
