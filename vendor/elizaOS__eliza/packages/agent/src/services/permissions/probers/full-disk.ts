/**
 * Full Disk Access prober.
 *
 * macOS has no public API to query Full Disk Access. The accepted
 * heuristic is to attempt to read a file that lives behind FDA in the
 * user's Library — `~/Library/Mail/V<N>/MailData/Accounts.plist` is a
 * canonical FDA-only file.
 *
 * There's no API to request FDA either; the user must add the app
 * manually in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access.
 * `request()` opens that pane and returns the post-open status.
 *
 * Status semantics:
 *   - granted: read succeeded
 *   - denied:  read EACCES'd (FDA explicitly missing)
 *   - not-determined: target file doesn't exist (user has no Mail.app
 *     setup) — we can't tell. Fall back to a second probe against
 *     ~/Library/Safari (also FDA-gated and almost always present).
