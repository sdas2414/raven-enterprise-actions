/**
 * Per-agent vault profile resolver.
 *
 * Walks every vault entry that has profile metadata, asks the vault's
 * routing layer which profile applies for the current agent, and pumps
 * the resolved value into `process.env[KEY]`. Runtime hot paths read
 * env vars synchronously (`process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, etc.), so
 * we resolve once at agent boot rather than instrumenting every call
 * site.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - Only `agent` scope rules apply; the runtime knows agentId.
 *   - `app` and `skill` scope rules are persisted for call sites that
 *     provide that context; this boot resolver has only agent context.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running for the same agent overwrites with the same
 * value. Opt-out via `ELIZA_DISABLE_VAULT_PROFILE_RESOLVER=1`.
