/**
 * Bounded memory retention for the append-only `memories` partitions (and the
 * `embeddings` rows that cascade with them). This is the mechanism that keeps
 * the core memory store from growing without bound — the failure class behind
 * the historical PGlite disk-fill: `memories` + `embeddings` accrete one row
 * per turn/fact/fragment forever, and nothing upstream prunes them.
 *
 * Two orthogonal, config-driven bounds, applied per (room, partition):
 *   - AGE: delete rows older than `retentionDays`.
 *   - COUNT: keep at most `maxRowsPerRoom` most-recent rows.
 * A row is a deletion candidate if EITHER bound would evict it; the newest
 * `maxRowsPerRoom` rows within the age window are always preserved. Deletion is
 * batched (via `deleteManyMemories`, which drops each memory's embeddings in the
 * same transaction) so a prune never issues one giant statement.
 *
 * SAFE DEFAULTS: retention is OFF unless explicitly configured. An unset or
 * non-positive `retentionDays` AND an unset/non-positive `maxRowsPerRoom` yields
 * an empty plan — the sweep is a no-op, so simply shipping this code changes no
 * behavior until an operator opts in.
 *
 * This module is pure: it computes a deletion plan from a snapshot of memory
 * ids + timestamps. All I/O (querying candidates, issuing deletes, scheduling)
 * lives in `memory-retention-service.ts`, so the eviction policy is unit-testable
 * without a database. It NEVER references any table other than the memory
 * partitions it is handed; other tables (auth audit, logs, central_messages)
 * are out of scope by construction.
