/**
 * Conversation-quality :: wrong-extraction-correction
 *
 * Failure mode: the agent's context holds a fact the user never actually stated
 * (a wrongly-extracted "vegetarian"). The user disputes it ("I never said
 * that"). The agent either argues that they did, over-apologizes in a spiral,
 * or narrates where the wrong fact came from in machinery terms ("my notes
 * said", "I must have recorded"). The human move is a light "ha, my bad, not
 * sure where I got that" and moving on.
 *
 * Motivating live regressions: defensiveness / machinery narration on a
 * disputed extraction.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): `responseExcludes` RegExps forbid machinery
 *     narration and self-justification on turn 1; turn 2 forbids any residue of
 *     the wrong fact.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms a light ownership and clean move-on.
 *
 * Synthetic persona (Ines Duarte, invented). No real data.
