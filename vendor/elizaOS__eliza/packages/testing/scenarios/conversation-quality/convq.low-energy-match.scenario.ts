/**
 * Conversation-quality :: low-energy-match
 *
 * Failure mode: the user sends a terse, low-effort beat ("lol", "nice", a bare
 * emoji) closing out an exchange, and the agent responds with a paragraph —
 * recapping, re-offering help, asking a follow-up question chain. Matching
 * register means matching ENERGY: a terse close gets a terse (or zero)
 * response, not an essay.
 *
 * This is the low end of register-matching that "add more personality" fixes
 * miss entirely: the skill being tested is knowing when the conversation is
 * OVER and letting it be over.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): brutal char budgets on the low-energy turns
 *     (<=60 / <=60), plus `responseExcludes` forbidding the re-engagement
 *     tells (follow-up question marks framed as "anything else", recaps,
 *     "let me know if").
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric grades "let the exchange end; no re-opening".
 *
 * Synthetic persona (Priya Raman). No real data.
