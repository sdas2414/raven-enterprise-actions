/**
 * Conversation-quality :: multi-agent-restraint
 *
 * Failure mode: a channel has MULTIPLE agents (this agent + other bot
 * assistants). A human posts one beat; another agent answers it; then this
 * agent ALSO answers — a redundant second reply to an already-answered human
 * instruction. Worse, agents start replying to EACH OTHER's messages with no
 * new human input, and the channel reverbs with agent chatter until a human
 * has to shout over it.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: a development channel with three agents where
 * every human beat drew two-to-three agent replies, plus agent-to-agent
 * replies stacking on top ("too much back and forth"). Distinct from the
 * single-agent reply-guy case: here the message may even be ON TOPIC for this
 * agent — the failure is piling on when another agent already has the floor.
 *
 * Contract under test (one speaker per human beat):
 *   - another agent already answered the human -> do not add a redundant reply
 *   - another agent's message, no new human instruction -> never reply to it
 *   - replies stacking (reply-to-a-reply) -> stop; wait for a human to advance
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): near-zero char budgets on the already-answered
 *     and agent-to-agent turns, plus `responseExcludes` forbidding the pile-on
 *     tells (restating the other agent's answer, "adding to what X said",
 *     addressing the other bot). The final turn (human directly re-addresses
 *     THIS agent) requires a real, concise answer — restraint is not muteness.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric grades "one speaker per human beat, no reverb,
 *     answered when re-addressed".
 *
 * Synthetic group (The Porch: Marcus, Dee, Toph + agent + synthetic bots
 * Quill, Marble). No real data.

Turn 2: Marble (another bot) replies to Quill with no new human input — this assistant must be COMPLETELY silent; replying to another bot's message with no human re-address is the reverb failure. Turn 3: a human jokes that 'the bots are having a whole meeting' — this is not an invitation; silence or a tiny self-aware beat at most.
