/**
 * Conversation-quality :: emotional-share
 *
 * Failure mode: the user shares something heavy (a loved one's bad medical
 * news) and the agent jumps to fix-it mode — numbered action lists, "here are
 * some things you can do", silver-lining platitudes ("at least...", "stay
 * positive", "everything happens for a reason"), or logistics. Presence, not
 * productivity, is the correct register for a hard emotional share.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: the agent responding to grief with checklists and
 * platitudes instead of sitting with the person.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): `responseExcludes` RegExps forbid list tells
 *     ("here are some", numbered "1." items), silver-lining platitudes, and
 *     fix-it framing on both turns.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms the reply sits with it — short, warm,
 *     specific — with at most one gentle question and no action list.
 *
 * Synthetic persona (Marcus Oyelaran, invented). No real data.
