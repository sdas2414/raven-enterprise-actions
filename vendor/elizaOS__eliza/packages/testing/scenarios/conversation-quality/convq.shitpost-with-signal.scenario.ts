/**
 * Conversation-quality :: shitpost-with-signal
 *
 * Failure mode: the user shares a jokey/absurdist post that actually carries a
 * real idea underneath, and the agent either (a) whiffs on the joke and
 * responds with an earnest literal take, or (b) gets the joke but then dumps an
 * essay. The correct register is: get the joke, add AT MOST one real
 * substantive beat, stay short.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: a shared satirical "collateralize your GPUs"
 * meme-post — the good live outcome (register-matched + one real thesis beat +
 * short) happened by luck, not by default; the default drifts to either a flat
 * literal unpacking or a wall of analysis.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): a char budget (<=450, room for one real beat
 *     but no essay), `responseExcludes` forbidding the earnest-literal tells
 *     ("actually, that would not work because...", safety-lecture phrasing,
 *     "here's a breakdown", numbered-list dumps).
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric grades "got the joke AND surfaced the real idea
 *     in one beat, within budget".
 *
 * Synthetic persona (Priya Raman) + fully invented meme-post (collateralized
 * sourdough starters). No real data.
