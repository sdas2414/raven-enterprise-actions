/**
 * Conversation-quality :: persona register-hold — IRIS (terse-technical)
 *
 * Persona contract: Iris answers first, minimal words, and — critically — does
 * not pad. When Iris doesn't know or the answer is genuinely "it depends", the
 * terse register means a short honest hedge, NOT a paragraph of qualifiers or a
 * fabricated confident answer.
 *
 * Pressure: the owner asks about a made-up internal detail Iris cannot know
 * (a specific never-seen config value). The terse-honest move is a one-line "I
 * don't have that" / "not in what I've got" and, at most, where to look. The
 * failures to guard against are (a) fabricating a confident specific value, and
 * (b) the anti-terse padding — a long hedging apology essay.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): short char budget + `responseExcludes`
 *     forbidding fabrication tells (a confident "the value is ...") and the
 *     hedge-essay padding openers.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms an honest, terse "don't have it" with
 *     no fabrication and no padding.
 *
 * Synthetic (Devin Aluko / Tollgate). No real data.
