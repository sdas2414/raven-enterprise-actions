/**
 * Conversation-quality :: persona charters (shared fixtures)
 *
 * The scenario runner boots a single bare `ScenarioAgent` character
 * (`runtime-factory.ts` → `createCharacter({ name: "ScenarioAgent" })`) with no
 * bio / system / style. There is no per-scenario character override in the
 * scenario schema, and this suite deliberately adds none — the existing
 * conversation-quality corpus added zero schema surface, and we keep that.
 *
 * So a "persona" here is expressed the same way a real deployment carries its
 * character contract into a running conversation: as a **durable owner-fact**
 * seeded via a plain `{ type: "memory", content: { text } }` step. That text is
 * written through `writeDurableFact` (seeds.ts) and surfaced by the core FACTS
 * provider during every turn — the exact path stored character/owner facts take
 * in production. The charter tells the agent who it is and how it should talk;
 * the scenario's turns then put that register under pressure and the mechanical
 * guards + judgeRubric verify the register HELD.
 *
 * This is a *register-consistency* harness: given an explicit persona contract
 * in context, does the agent keep the contract when the user bait pulls the
 * other way (emotional bait on a terse persona, a task demand on a warm one,
 * casual over-familiarity bait on a professional one, a formal/stiff bait on a
 * playful one)? A persona that only holds its register when unchallenged is not
 * a persona.
 *
 * Every name, place, and project below is a fully invented synthetic. No real
 * person, project, or place appears.
