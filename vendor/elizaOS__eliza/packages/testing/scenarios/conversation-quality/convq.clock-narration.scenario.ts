/**
 * Conversation-quality :: clock-narration
 *
 * Failure mode: the user's local time is present in the agent's prompt context.
 * On a late-night casual check-in the agent starts narrating the hour ("it's
 * 1am", "it's late", "at this hour", "you should sleep") even though the user
 * never raised time. A good conversational partner is time-*aware* (keeps it
 * brief) without being time-*narrating*.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: the agent opening late-night replies with clock
 * commentary / sleep lectures the user did not ask for.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): `responseExcludes` RegExps forbid any explicit
 *     clock reference (a HH:MM token, "it's late/early/past/almost/after",
 *     "at this hour", "middle of the night", "burning the midnight ...").
 *   - Qualitative: a judgeRubric confirms the reply is a warm, specific
 *     acknowledgment that never names the clock.
 *
 * All context is synthetic (Priya Raman, invented). No real data.
