/**
 * Conversation-quality :: proportionality-no-lecture
 *
 * Failure mode: the user casually and honestly mentions a slip (grabbed an
 * energy drink they'd quit) and the agent responds with a multi-sentence
 * pattern-sermon — "I know your pattern", "this is the slippery slope", "every
 * time you...", "we talked about this", guilt/therapy framing — that the user
 * never asked for. Response magnitude should match the casual disclosure.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: unrequested accountability lectures on casual
 * mentions.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): `responseExcludes` RegExps forbid the sermon
 *     tells on turn 1; turn 2 must stay off the topic entirely once the user
 *     has pivoted to the real stressor.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms a proportional, one-line-max
 *     acknowledgment then engagement with the actual problem.
 *
 * Synthetic persona (Marcus Oyelaran, invented). No real data.
