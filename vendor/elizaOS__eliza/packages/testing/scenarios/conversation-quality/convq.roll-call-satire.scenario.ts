/**
 * Conversation-quality :: roll-call-satire
 *
 * Failure mode: a human does a playful multi-mention roll call ("ROLL CALL
 * @X @Y @Z who is ALIVE in here") — obviously a bit — and the agent answers it
 * dead-literal, like a form: "I'm awake, how can I help?" / "Online and
 * operational, what do you need?". The correct register is to read it as a bit
 * and play it back in ONE short line, with no assistant-services pivot.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: a playful roll call across several agents drew
 * literal earnest status reports ("awake, what's up") from every agent — no
 * read of the satire.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): a hard char budget (one line, <=120) plus
 *     `responseExcludes` forbidding the literal-status and assistant-pivot
 *     tells ("how can I help", "what do you need", "operational",
 *     "at your service", "standing by").
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric grades "read it as a bit, one light line,
 *     didn't answer like a form".
 *
 * Synthetic group (The Porch: Marcus, Dee, Toph + agent + two other synthetic
 * bots Quill/Marble). No real data.
