/**
 * Conversation-quality :: verbosity / default-to-short
 *
 * Failure mode: a light banter beat (roommate being absurd about hot-dog
 * taxonomy) gets a wall of text, a pivot to productivity ("anyway, about
 * Lanternfish..."), or a forced closing question. The correct register for
 * banter is short, playful, and matched to the user's energy — no task pivot,
 * no forced question.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: verbosity / always-pivot-to-productivity on
 * casual beats.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): a hard char budget on both banter turns, plus
 *     `responseExcludes` forbidding the productivity-pivot and forced-question
 *     tells.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms the agent plays along and matches
 *     energy without a productivity pivot.
 *
 * Synthetic persona (Priya Raman, invented). No real data.
