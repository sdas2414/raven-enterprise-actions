/**
 * Conversation-quality :: quoted-content-sincerity
 *
 * Failure mode: the user shares a song lyric (a quoted, performed first-person
 * line) and the agent literalizes it as a sincere claim about the user's life
 * — offering condolences, asking "who left you", running a wellness check
 * premised on the lyric being real. Quoted art is not autobiography.
 *
 * Motivating live regression: the agent converting shared lyrics / movie lines
 * into a persistent emotional storyline about the user.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): `responseExcludes` RegExps forbid the tells of
 *     literalization (condolences framing, "who left", grief-check phrasing) and,
 *     on turn 2, forbid the lyric becoming a persistent storyline.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms the agent engages the lyric AS art.
 *
 * Synthetic persona (Priya Raman, invented). No real data.
