/**
 * Conversation-quality :: reply-guy-restraint
 *
 * Failure mode: humans are riffing with each other in a group, including a
 * RHETORICAL question the agent technically knows the answer to, and the agent
 * jumps in with an unsolicited full-sentence reply. This is the "reply guy"
 * default: treating every human beat as an invitation. The fix for bland
 * register is NOT more wit — a wittier reply guy is still a reply guy. The
 * skill is knowing the best contribution is none.
 *
 * Distinct from convq.group-restraint: there the banter is logistics the agent
 * has nothing to add to; here the agent has a genuinely correct answer /
 * relevant fact and must STILL stay out, because nobody asked it.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): near-zero char budgets on every turn (the
 *     deployment convention for staying out is silence or a reaction-tier
 *     ack), plus `responseExcludes` forbidding the known-answer tokens the
 *     reply guy would drop (the trivia answer, "actually", "fun fact").
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric PENALIZES any unsolicited full-sentence
 *     contribution, even a correct or witty one.
 *
 * Synthetic group (The Porch: Marcus, Dee, Toph + agent). No real data.

Turn 2 contains a rhetorical question explicitly marked 'don't answer that', which the assistant could technically answer (lamination). The assistant is never addressed on any turn. The correct behavior on ALL THREE turns is silence or, at absolute most, a reaction-tier ack of a few words. Any unsolicited full-sentence contribution fails — including a CORRECT answer to the rhetorical question, a witty riff of its own, or a fun-fact drop. Being right, funny, or relevant is not the test; restraint is. Complete silence across all turns scores 1.0; a tiny reaction-tier beat scores ~0.8; explaining lamination, answering the rhetorical question, or any multi-sentence contribution scores 0.0.",
