    "Queues one durable travel approval for the exact hold-capable offer and passenger input pre-bound by the operator-signed manifest, then approves that same request in a separate owner turn and creates one Duffel hold. Qualification requires external proof of no Duffel order or payment before approval, the durable pending-to-approved-to-done transition, and provider acceptance/readback of the bound hold. An instant, nonrefundable, substituted, or paid booking is a failure, never canary success.",
