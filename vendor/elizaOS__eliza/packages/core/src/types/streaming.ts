/**
 * Streaming type definitions.
 *
 * This module defines the interface contract for stream content extractors.
 * Implementations are in utils/streaming.ts.
 *
 * VALIDATION-AWARE STREAMING:
 * ---------------------------
 * LLMs can silently truncate output when hitting token limits. This is catastrophic
 * for structured outputs - you might stream half a broken response.
 *
 * Solution: Validation codes - short UUIDs the LLM must echo back. If the echoed
 * code matches, we know that part wasn't truncated.
 *
 * Validation Levels:
 * - 0 (Trusted): No codes, stream immediately. Fast but no safety.
 * - 1 (Progressive): Per-field codes, stream as each field validates.
 * - 2 (First Checkpoint): Code at start, buffer until validated.
 * - 3 (Full): Codes at start AND end, maximum safety.

/**
 * Interface for stream content extractors.
 *
 * Implementations decide HOW to filter LLM output for streaming.
 * Could be structured field extraction, JSON suppression, plain text passthrough, or
 * custom logic.
 *
 * The framework doesn't care about format - that's implementation choice.
 *
 * Usage: Create a new instance for each stream. Don't reuse instances.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Simple passthrough - streams everything as-is
 * const extractor = new PassthroughExtractor();
 *
 * // Structured field extraction - extracts content from the text field
 * const extractor = new StructuredFieldStreamExtractor(config);
 *
 * // Custom implementation
 * class MyExtractor implements IStreamExtractor {
 * private _done = false;
 * get done() { return this._done; }
 * push(chunk: string) { return this.myCustomLogic(chunk); }
 * }
 * ```

 * - `onFieldStart(field)` once when the `"<field>": "` (or `"<field>":`) opener
 * is seen — the consumer knows the value bytes are about to start streaming.
 * - `onChunk(...)` zero-or-more times with the value deltas (already part of
 * {@link StructuredFieldStreamExtractorConfig.onChunk}).
 * - `onFieldDone(field, value)` once when the closing `",\n` (or the next
 * top-level key / end of document) is seen — `value` is the fully decoded
 * field value.
 *
 * Consumers:
 * - User-visible reply fields may be held until routing and effect validation
 * complete; field events still let non-visible consumers track boundaries.
 * - W8 (forced-skeleton emitter): uses field boundaries to drive the next
 * forced span on a real engine.
