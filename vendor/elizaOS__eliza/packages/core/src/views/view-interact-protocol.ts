/**
 * Canonical view-interact protocol contract shared by the agent server and the
 * UI. The agent's views route (`packages/agent/src/api/views-routes.ts`) and the
 * UI's DynamicViewLoader both dispatch against the same capability ids, so the
 * ids live here — in the shared workspace contract — rather than inside UI
 * internals, keeping the agent buildable without an `@elizaos/ui` dependency.
 *
 * The flow:
 * 1. Agent POSTs to /api/views/:id/interact with a ViewInteractRequest body.
 * 2. Server broadcasts a WS message {type:"view:interact",...} to all clients.
 * 3. DynamicViewLoader receives the WS message, calls the view module's
 * interact(capability, params) export (or a standard capability handler).
 * 4. Frontend sends {type:"view:interact:result",...} back over WS.
 * 5. Server resolves the pending request and returns the result to the agent.
