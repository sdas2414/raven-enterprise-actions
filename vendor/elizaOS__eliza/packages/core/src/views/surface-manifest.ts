/**
 * How a view is separated from the host realm and from other views. Ordered
 * from least to most isolated. Each view declares its level in its manifest,
 * which determines its per-platform embedding
 * (Electron `WebContentsView`, sandboxed `<iframe>`, `WKWebView`/Android
 * `WebView`).
 *
 * - `in-process` — trusted built-in shell views run in the host DOM/React
 * realm with the full host singleton (React, API client,
 * native bridges). No sandbox; trust is the boundary.
 * - `sandboxed-iframe` — untrusted/plugin web views run in a sandboxed iframe
 * with a postMessage capability broker. Never combine
 * `allow-scripts` + `allow-same-origin` on same-origin
 * content — that is not a real sandbox (MDN).
 * - `native-webview` — heavy/untrusted views embed a native child web-content
 * surface (desktop `WebContentsView`, iOS `WKWebView`,
 * Android `WebView`) with its own renderer process and an
 * explicit process/storage-sharing policy.
 * - `immersive` — a fullscreen surface that owns its whole window
 * (launcher, background editor). Chrome-free and the only
 * non-launcher level allowed to paint the shared
 * wallpaper, and only when it also grants `wallpaper`.

 * - `wallpaper` — may paint the shared Home/Launcher wallpaper. Gates
 * `background: "shared"`: a view without this grant is
 * forced opaque no matter what it declares. Restricted

 * - `background:apply` — may drive the global background-apply broker (change
 * the persisted wallpaper for the whole app). The
 * background editor holds it; normal views do not.
 * - `navigate` — may request shell navigation (open another view).
 * - `storage` — may use host-scoped persistent storage.
 * - `agent-surface` — may expose its DOM elements to the agent surface so
 * the planner can read/click/fill them. Standard
 * read-only introspection is always available; this
 * grant is for a view opting INTO richer agent control.
