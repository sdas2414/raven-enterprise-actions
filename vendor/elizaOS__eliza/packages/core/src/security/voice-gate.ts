/**
 * The humanness voice gate: the single canonical last-mile pass that
 * rewrites any outbound literal into the agent's own natural voice before it
 * reaches a user, so a user never sees a hardcoded template, a canned status
 * string, or a raw `error.message`. The owner directive is absolute — "we
 * always want response messages to the user to be as if a real person
 * responded to them, no hardcoded messages or injections, even errors should
 * be rephrased."
 *
 * There is no single byte-level chokepoint: agent text leaves through two
 * transports (connector send vs in-app WebSocket) plus notifications. So "one
 * seam" is one gate implementation mandated at each transport boundary, not one
 * literal function call — {@link ensureAgentVoice} is invoked at
 * `AgentRuntime.sendMessageToTarget` (every connector-delivered agent message)
 * and at the in-app proactive relay. It is gated by the `agentVoiced`
 * provenance flag: text that is already the agent's composed voice (a
 * model-generated reply, or output this gate already rephrased) passes through
 * untouched, so genuine model output is never double-voiced and its exact
 * values are never disturbed.
 *
 * Same model seam as the scheduled-dispatch renderer and the failure-reply
 * path — `runWithTrajectoryPurpose` + `runtime.useModel` — but on ModelType
 * TEXT_SMALL with a per-agent input-hash cache, because this runs on every
 * outbound literal and must stay cheap. It diverges from the dispatch
 * renderer's fail-fast in one deliberate way (V1 below): the gate is a cosmetic
 * pass over already-final text, so a rephrase failure delivers the ORIGINAL
 * text unchanged and reports the error, never blocking delivery — dropping a
 * real user message is strictly worse than delivering one raw literal once with
 * the outage flagged.
