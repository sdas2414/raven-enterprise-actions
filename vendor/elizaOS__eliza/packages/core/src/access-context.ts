 * `worldId`, else the connector-metadata fallback (e.g. a Discord server/channel
 * id). Deriving all three from one resolution is load-bearing: resolving the
 * role against one world while reading `worldId` off a different path can yield
 * `role: "OWNER"` with `worldId: undefined` — an elevated role with no tenant
 * scope. Outside a world (DMs, or a message with no resolvable world) all three
