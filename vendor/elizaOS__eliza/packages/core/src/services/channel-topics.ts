/**
 * ChannelTopicsService — per-channel topic LRU.
 *
 * Maintains, per `roomId`, a bounded most-recently-used list of short topic
 * labels extracted at Stage-1 (the `topics` field-evaluator). The list is the
 * running answer to "what is this channel about lately?" and is surfaced back
 * into Stage-1 routing through the `CHANNEL_TOPICS` provider so shouldRespond /
 * the planner can weigh topic relevance.
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - Bounded LRU per room. {@link CHANNEL_TOPICS_LRU_CAPACITY} slots
 * (≈ the last ~100 messages worth of distinct topics). FIFO eviction:
 * when the list is full, the oldest entry is dropped to make room.
 * - Dedupe on insert: re-recording an existing topic refreshes its recency
 * (moves it to the most-recent end) rather than adding a duplicate.
 * - Ordering: index 0 is the OLDEST, the last index is the MOST RECENT.
 *
 * Persistence:
 * - Each room's list is mirrored to `room.metadata.currentTopics` via
 * `runtime.updateRoom` so it survives a restart.
 * - The in-memory cache is hydrated from `room.metadata.currentTopics` the
 * first time a room is touched.
 * - Missing rooms are expected during deletion races and skip persistence;
 * database failures propagate to the message-loop boundary for reporting.
 *
 * This service is PURE LOGIC (no fs / process / native deps) so it is safe for
 * the Node, browser, and edge build targets.
