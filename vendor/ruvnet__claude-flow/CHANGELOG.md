## [Unreleased]

## [3.56.0] - 2026-10-08

Minor release: a hardening and correctness batch from @rudycelekli, @nicholas-ruest, @martinvlad, @HF-teamdev, @drakeo338 and @stuinfla. Several fixes change behaviour on purpose (see Behaviour changes). Integrated by merging each PR head, so authorship is preserved.

### Behaviour changes

- **Unknown ids and value-less options are now errors (#3911, @martinvlad)** — `agent status` / `task status` with an unknown id print `not found` and exit 1; a declared string/number option with no value (`hooks route --task`) now reports `Option --task needs a value` instead of silently becoming `true`. Applies to every command.
- **`session_save` captures the persisted task/agent/memory stores by default, and `session_import` rejects malformed stores (#3489, #3490)**; explicit `false` still excludes a store.
- **Default project memory backup snapshots both `memory.db` and `agentdb-memory.db` (#3903)**; explicit `--db` and a non-blank `CLAUDE_FLOW_DB_PATH` still select one file.
- **Agent pool scale-to-zero is honored and invalid targets fail before writing (#3488)**; a zero fallback retry budget is honored (#3496).
- **Project path validators block sensitive directory names anywhere under the project root, not only at the leaf (#3504, `@claude-flow/security` 3.0.3)**.
- **The OAuth callback server retains an early callback and ignores unrelated requests (#3507, `@claude-flow/security` 3.0.3)**.
- **Provider selection honors an explicit execution provider (#3493) and Anthropic gateway credentials/endpoint (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; #3494, fixes #3100)**; provider timeouts now cover reading the response body (#3495).
- **`hooks_route` consults persisted SONA outcome patterns before local routing (#3904)** — only a supported agent at confidence >= 0.6 is used; `useSemanticRouter: false` keeps keyword routing. **With the opt-in neural router, selection uses calibrated quality predictions (#3498)** so calibration can move the pick across the quality bar.
- **The WAL-sidecar safety gate is liveness-based (#3894, fixes #3161)** — leftover `-wal`/`-shm` files from a closed connection no longer block `memory store`/`list`; a genuinely open holder is still refused.
- **`ruflo init` no longer pins a Claude model in generated `.claude/settings.json` (#3528, fixes #3527)**.
- **The `ruflo` wrapper pins the matching `@claude-flow/cli` and warns when the resolved CLI version differs (#3438, fixes #3306)**; it warns and continues, it does not refuse.
- **Claims are stored in one lossless format shared by CLI and MCP; unreadable stores are refused rather than replaced (#3502)**.
- **Native immutable conditional append for `memory store` (`--append-only`, `--append-conditions`, `--require-native`, `--no-embedding`; #3750, @stuinfla)** — additive, CLI only.

### Fixed

- Shipped `.claude/settings.json` had unescaped quotes in hook commands and did not parse (#3895, fixes #3888, @nicholas-ruest); a new test checks that every shipped settings/plugin JSON parses.
- Remaining `better-sqlite3` opens go through the shared loader (#3896, fixes #3883's sites, @nicholas-ruest); an RFE1-encrypted store is reported as encrypted, not broken (#3906, fixes #2889, @nicholas-ruest); the demo-registry fallback is labelled as unverified (#3897, @martinvlad).
- `analyze` preserves machine-readable JSON (#3910); `doctor` rejects unsupported component selections (#3907) and loads MetaHarness modules via file URLs on Windows (#3523, fixes #3186); `daemon start` honors explicit scheduled workers (#3586).
- Unreadable task/agent records are preserved, not overwritten (#3484); async agent-registry updates do not revive retired agents (#3492); fallback learning is attributed to each attempted model (#3497).
- Workflow step boundaries are validated (#3491), persisted workflows resume without duplicate executors (#3500) and keep control signals and sibling state across awaits (#3505).
- Memory JSON import reports rejected writes accurately (#3499); export reads all pages only after successful reads (#3501); concurrent rotating-token refreshes coalesce (#3506).
- Test fixtures no longer break under pnpm's `NODE_PATH` (#3543, fixes #3529) and the vitest runner is resolved via `package.json`.
- `@claude-flow/memory` 3.0.2: cache admission accounts for replacement sizes (#3679, fixes #3678) and invalidation matches each key independently (#3687, fixes #3686).
- Removed an empty `.claude/agents/tmp.json` that shipped in the CLI tarball.

### Not included

### Leaf packages published with this release

`@claude-flow/memory` 3.0.2, `@claude-flow/security` 3.0.3.

## [3.55.0] - 2026-10-07

Minor release. Contains a security behaviour change: `ruflo mcp start -t http` on a non-loopback host now refuses to start without a token (see Security and Breaking changes).

### Security

- **MCP HTTP transport: refuse unauthenticated non-loopback binds, optional bearer-token auth (#3598, #3599)** — `ruflo mcp start -t http --host 0.0.0.0` (or any non-loopback host) now exits 1 unless a token is set (`RUFLO_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, `--auth-token-file`, `--auth-token`) or the operator opts out with `RUFLO_MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_HTTP=1`. With a token, `/rpc`, `/mcp` and `/info` need `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (constant-time compare); `/health` stays public and minimal. Also fixes a fail-open in `@claude-flow/mcp` where auth enabled with an empty token list accepted any bearer value. **Not closed:** loopback with no token is still unauthenticated (any local process can call every tool, and DNS rebinding is not blocked because there is no `Host` allow-list); set a token whenever the HTTP transport is used. A valid token grants every tool (no per-tool authorization).
- **Hive-mind gating that keeps local users working (ADR-476, #3338, #3339)** — `hive-mind_init` no longer returns `hiveToken`, and `spawn`, `consensus` `propose`, `broadcast`, `shutdown`, `memory` `set`/`delete` and `optimize-memory` (plus the existing `join`/`leave`/`vote`) now require an operator credential from **remote** callers (HTTP/WebSocket MCP). Local stdio MCP, `ruflo mcp exec`, the `hive-mind` CLI and in-process callers need no credential and no extra step. Remote clients set `RUFLO_HIVE_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` (or read `.claude-flow/hive-mind/bootstrap.secret`, created 0600 by the first local `hive-mind init`) and send it as `bootstrapSecret`; `RUFLO_HIVE_REQUIRE_AUTH=1` applies the same rule to stdio on bridged servers. `state.json` is now written 0600 atomically and the hive directory 0700. Migration: clients that read `hiveToken` from the `init` response must drop that (it is `undefined`); over stdio they omit it everywhere. This is a speed bump, not a boundary, against a local prompt-injected agent that can read the files.
- **Policy ledger anchor can no longer be deleted and silently re-established (#3602, #3886, ADR-475)** — `policy verify` no longer trusts an anchor stored only in `state.json`. A second, hash-chained anchor log plus a mirror under `~/.config/ruflo/policy-trust/` now detect truncation, and `policy verify --establish-anchor` (interactive TTY only) is the logged repair path. Limit: this does not defend against an attacker who can rewrite both the project directory and `~/.config/ruflo`; stronger evidence needs an external witness. A pre-#3568 ledger with receipts and no anchor now fails policy transactions with `policy-ledger-anchor-missing` until repaired. Ships in `@claude-flow/security` 3.0.2.

### Fixed

- **Resilience batch (#3885; fixes #3676 #3674 #3668 #3670 #3682 #3672 #3593 #3592; thanks @rudycelekli)** — `@claude-flow/shared` 3.0.2: event-store pagination, bulkhead sync-throw handling, retry timeout cleanup, connection-pool reservation (also in `@claude-flow/mcp`); cli: production retry on non-Error rejections, worker-queue terminal outcomes and cancelled head, bounded worker pool with an already-aborted input.
- **`@claude-flow/memory` 3.0.1 — `mmrRerank()` caches embedding-cosine max-similarity across rounds (#3516, #3517)**.
- **`@claude-flow/swarm` 3.0.1** — Byzantine quorums now intersect for every cluster size (#3560, #3587, @rudycelekli); `spawnAgent()` auto-domain branch registers the agent in its pool (#3538, #3539); `MessageBus` is event-driven instead of a 10 ms unconditional poll (#3563).
- **`@claude-flow/plugin-agent-federation` 1.0.1** — outbound sends are authorized with the peer's current trust, not a stale snapshot (#3561, #3588, @rudycelekli).
- **CLI string options keep their declared value (#3594, #3601)**, **config cache is isolated per project directory (#3590, #3591)**, **nested config defaults are cloned (#3595, #3600)** — all @rudycelekli.
- **Hive consensus commands fail when the hive rejects the operation (#3609, #3654, @rudycelekli)**.
- **`daemon start --workers` selection reaches the WorkerDaemon (#3547, #3875)**.
- **Plugins run the installed ruflo CLI before `npx @claude-flow/cli@latest` (#3558, #3559, @HF-teamdev)** — ruflo-cost-tracker 0.27.2, ruflo-adr 0.5.4, ruflo-metaharness 0.2.4, ruflo-goals 0.4.3.
- **ruflo-adr edge keys use a separator the memory validator accepts (#3633, #3636, @drakeo338)**.
- ruflo-console 0.36.1: Settings lists Claude control and spending first (#3887).

### Breaking changes

- Binding the MCP HTTP transport off loopback (for example Docker with `--host 0.0.0.0`) now requires `RUFLO_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` (and clients must send the header) or `RUFLO_MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_HTTP=1`; otherwise `mcp start` exits with an error. Loopback users are unaffected.
- `hive-mind_init` no longer returns `hiveToken` (ADR-476).

### Leaf packages published with this release

`@claude-flow/shared` 3.0.2, `@claude-flow/memory` 3.0.1, `@claude-flow/swarm` 3.0.1, `@claude-flow/security` 3.0.2, `@claude-flow/mcp` 3.1.0, `@claude-flow/plugin-agent-federation` 1.0.1.

## [3.34.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **AGNTCY/Outshift runtime integration (ADR-378/379/380)** — optional, removable augmentation per ADR-150's pattern; the kernel stays fully operational with these packages absent. `ruflo transport use slim`, `ruflo agent publish`, and `ruflo swarm join <namespace>` CLI verbs; CASA (Continuous Agentic Semantic Authorization) envelope schema, deterministic compiler, and deny-by-default enforcement gate with Ed25519-signed decision receipts (`.swarm/casa-receipts.jsonl`); AGNTCY OTel span attributes (`coordination.episode`, `authorization.decision`). All verbs exit 0 with a clear message when `RUFLO_AGNTCY_SLIM_ENDPOINT` is unset — no fake success paths. Companion Rust crate `v3/crates/ruflo-agntcy` mirrors the TS enforcement logic, with a real in-process `LocalTransport` and a `SlimTransport` stub behind a non-default `slim` Cargo feature. Companion package `@metaharness/agntcy` (build-time half — identity, OASF export, Directory publish, semantic observability) ships from the sibling `metaharness` repo. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/commands/agntcy/`, `plugins/ruflo-agntcy/`, `v3/crates/ruflo-agntcy/`, `v3/docs/adr/ADR-378-*.md`, `ADR-379-*.md`, `ADR-380-*.md`)
- **npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) release workflow (ADR-378)** — `.github/workflows/stable-npm-release.yml` publishes the three-package stable train (`@claude-flow/cli`, `claude-flow`, `ruflo`) from an immutable, tag-pinned checkout with a full test/build/pack/install smoke-test gate before any registry write, verifies published-package integrity against the locally-built archive, and rolls out `latest`/`alpha`/`v3alpha` dist-tags together. Manual `workflow_dispatch` only, gated to the `ruvnet` actor.
- Configurable statusline cost segment via two environment variables (defaults unchanged):
  - `RUFLO_STATUSLINE_COST_SYMBOL` — override the leading `$` (e.g. `⚡`, `€`, `🌱`); empty string shows the number alone.
  - `RUFLO_STATUSLINE_HIDE_COST` — `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` hides the segment. `cost.total_cost_usd` is a client-side estimate that may differ from the actual bill and is misleading on subscription plans.

### Fixed

- **`@agntcy/slim-bindings` pinned to the confirmed-working alpha** — the SLIM maintainers moved off `uniffi-bindgen-react-native` (which shipped raw, uncompiled TypeScript incompatible with plain Node `require`/`import` — filed as agntcy/slim#1916, reproduced and confirmed) onto `@ubjs/core`/`@ubjs/node` in the `2.0.0-alpha.4+` dist-tag, not yet promoted to `latest`. `v3/@claude-flow/cli/package.json` now pins the exact working alpha version (deliberate exact-pin for a pre-release channel, not a caret range) rather than the still-broken `latest`; verified live end-to-end (server bring-up, client connect, graceful shutdown, zero `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`). `detectAgntcyRuntime()` required zero logic changes — its existing graceful-degradation design already returned `configured: true` once the upstream package resolved.
- **`security scan` failed open on unvalidated `--depth` / `--type` / `--target`** — an unrecognised `--type` matched none of the three phase guards, so no phase ran at all and the command still printed "No security issues found!" and exited 0; an unrecognised `--depth` fell through chained ternaries to the *shallowest* traversal (so `--depth full` scanned less than the default `standard`), which on a tree whose only HIGH finding sat below that budget also flipped the critical/high exit-code gate from 1 to 0; and a non-existent or non-directory `--target` read nothing, which the swallowed dir-read catches turned into a clean banner, exit 0, and a **persisted CLEAN report** that `getSecurityStatus` then surfaced as CLEAN. All three now fail closed before anything is scanned or written. Chained ternaries replaced with exhaustive `Record<ScanDepth, number>` maps behind real type predicates, and the recursion guard now positive-tests its budget so a bad value stops traversal instead of disabling the limiter. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/commands/security.ts`)

### Changed

- **`security scan --depth full` is deprecated, not removed** — `full` was never a supported depth, but the CLI itself emitted it (statusline insight, announcement, the CLAUDE.md `init` generates, two shipped agent definitions). It is now normalised to `deep` with a warning rather than rejected, and those emitters have been updated to `--depth deep`. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/funnel/insights.ts`, `funnel/messages.ts`, `commands/announcements.ts`, `init/claudemd-generator.ts`, `.claude/agents/v3/security-architect*.md`)

### Removed

- **`security scan --type container` is rejected instead of silently reporting clean** — it had been advertised in `--type`'s help since the command was written, but no phase ever implemented it, so it scanned nothing and printed a clean bill of health. It now exits 1 with an explicit "not implemented" message, and the help text no longer offers it. **Breaking** for any pipeline passing `--type container`, which previously exited 0. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/commands/security.ts`)

## [3.32.10] - 2026-07-26

Bug-fix release closing the tracker-fire sweep from 2026-07-24 → 2026-07-26. All fixes are surgical and additive; no API surface change, no schema change, patch semver.

### Fixed

- **Statusline promo row blank on new installs** — restored the cold-start local seed pool that ADR-311 had emptied. The remote Cognitum-served pool (`funnel.ruv.io/v1/messages`) remains authoritative via `eligibleMessagesFromPools` (remote wins by `id`); the seed only renders during the ≤ 60s cold-start window before the first successful remote fetch lands. Nine seed messages ship: one disclosure, seven educational tips (all pointing at `cognitum.one` docs), one promotional. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/funnel/messages.ts`)
- **#2777** — `ruflo init` no longer imports the entire ruvnet/ruflo repo (97 MB, 384 `SKILL.md`) into `.agents/skills/ruflo/`. Materialization now writes only the single platform `SKILL.md`, and the idempotency gate detects a "bloated" prior install (Cargo.toml/crates/ present or size > 1 MB) and wipes+re-materializes. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/commands/init.ts`)
- **#2781** — `ruflo-adr adr-index` no longer silently drops ADR data: status regex accepts the `- **Status**: proposed` form `adr-create` emits, single-line and wrapped relation lines parse fully, and `CLI_CORE=1` no longer forks writes into an alternate store the default reader can't see (warns and unifies on `@claude-flow/cli@latest`). Dry-run over the repo's 531 ADRs now captures 608 edges cleanly. (`plugins/ruflo-adr/scripts/lib/parse-adrs.mjs`, `import.mjs`, `reindex.mjs`)
- **#2770** — Windows: `browser-session` MCP tools and two init-flow `execFileSync('npx', …)` sites now set `shell: process.platform === 'win32'` so cmd.exe can resolve `npx.cmd`. POSIX behavior unchanged. Each site carries a shell-injection note for future editors. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/mcp-tools/browser-tools.ts`, `v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/commands/init.ts`)
- **#2782** — `WorkerDaemon.saveState()`, `autopilot-state.saveState()`, and `autopilot-state.appendLog()` no longer race on a shared `.tmp` filename under in-process concurrent workers. All three sites now call the existing `writeFileAtomic` helper (pid + timestamp + random-suffixed temp) so concurrent callers cannot collide; each write is wrapped in try/catch so a losing racer can't crash the daemon. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/services/worker-daemon.ts`, `v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/autopilot-state.ts`)
- **#2785** — `ruflo hooks post-task` now accepts `--task` (short `-t`) and `--store-results` flags, matching the CLAUDE.md-documented usage. Routing outcomes finally persist to the namespace `hooks_metrics` reads, so the "Pattern Learning" / "Agent Routing" numbers become non-zero. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/commands/hooks.ts`)
- **#2786** — AgentDB no longer silently fails to initialize when `CLAUDE_FLOW_ENCRYPT_AT_REST=1` is set. Added `getAgentDbPath()` which returns the same directory as `getDbPath()` but with basename `agentdb-memory.db`, so the ControllerRegistry (native better-sqlite3) opens a distinct file from the sql.js CRUD writer's `memory.db` (which stays encrypted). `learningSystem`/`reasoningBank` populate correctly with encryption enabled. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/memory/memory-bridge.ts`)
- **#2776** — Statusline security segment: `STALE` and `IN_PROGRESS` states are now reachable via a local overlay (`getLocalSecurity`) that recomputes freshness on every render from `.claude/security-scans/scan-*.json`. Configurable via `RUFLO_SCAN_STALE_HOURS` (default 24) and `RUFLO_SCAN_PENDING_CAP_MIN` (default 30); STALE renders dim gray so it stops shouting for attention once escalated. (`.claude/helpers/statusline.cjs`)
- **#2775** — Memory store to an existing key no longer dead-ends: `bridgeStoreEntry` uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` with tombstone auto-resurrect; UNIQUE returns a typed error instead of `null` (no more misleading demotion into the #2735 guard); `bridgeDeleteEntry` runs `wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)`; CLI `memory store --upsert` default now applies at the parser layer (root cause: `parser.ts:applyDefaults` only walked `globalOptions`); the `memory_store` MCP tool schema defaults `upsert: true` for CLI parity. (`v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/memory/memory-bridge.ts`, `commands/memory.ts`, `parser.ts`, `mcp-tools/memory-tools.ts`)

### Investigated

- **#2774** — Reporter's diagnosis "Codex MCP generator registers management CLI instead of stdio server" appears incorrect: `ruflo mcp start` IS a working stdio server per `v3/@claude-flow/cli/src/commands/mcp.ts` (`MCP Server started on stdio`), and upstream `d20f1323b fix(codex): ship stable Windows-safe Ruflo integration` cleanly centralized the Codex MCP config in `mcp-config.ts` using the same command shape. A proposed swap to `claude-flow-mcp` was reverted during rebase. Recommend closing the issue unless the reporter can produce a fresh repro against 3.32.9+.
