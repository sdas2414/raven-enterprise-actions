# ruflo-ddd

Domain-Driven Design scaffolding -- bounded contexts, aggregate roots, domain events, and anti-corruption layers.

## Overview

Transforms business domains into well-structured bounded contexts with aggregate roots, value objects, domain events, repositories, and anti-corruption layers. Stores the domain model as a navigable graph in AgentDB with hierarchical nodes and causal edges for context dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
claude --plugin-dir plugins/ruflo-ddd
```

## Agents

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `domain-modeler` | sonnet | Map domains to bounded contexts, design aggregates with invariants, define domain events, generate ACL interfaces |

## Skills

| Skill | Usage | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `ddd-context` | `/ddd-context <context-name>` | Create a bounded context with standard directory structure |
| `ddd-aggregate` | `/ddd-aggregate <context> <aggregate-name>` | Scaffold an aggregate root with entity, value objects, repository, events, and test stubs |
| `ddd-validate` | `/ddd-validate` | Detect cross-context import violations and aggregate invariant issues |

## Commands (6 subcommands)

```bash
# Context management
ddd context create <name>
ddd context list

# Aggregate scaffolding
ddd aggregate <context> <name>
ddd event <context> <name>

# Validation & visualization
ddd validate                 # Check domain boundary violations
ddd map                      # Visualize context map with relationships
```

## Directory Structure per Context

```
src/<context-name>/
  domain/
    entities/           # Entities and aggregate root
    value-objects/       # Immutable value objects
    events/             # Domain events
    services/           # Domain services
    repositories/       # Repository interfaces
  application/          # Use cases / application services
  infrastructure/       # Repository implementations, ACL adapters
  index.ts              # Public API of the context
```

## Context Relationships

Detected via import analysis: upstream/downstream, ACL, shared kernel, published language. Boundary violations (direct cross-context imports) are flagged by `ddd validate`.

## Compatibility

- **CLI:** pinned to `@claude-flow/cli` v3.6 major+minor.
- **Verification:** `bash plugins/ruflo-ddd/scripts/smoke.sh` is the contract.

## Namespace coordination

This plugin owns the `ddd-patterns` AgentDB namespace (kebab-case, follows the convention from [ruflo-agentdb ADR-0001 §"Namespace convention"](../ruflo-agentdb/docs/adrs/0001-agentdb-optimization.md)). Reserved namespaces (`pattern`, `claude-memories`, `default`) MUST NOT be shadowed.

`ddd-patterns` stores reusable bounded-context shapes, aggregate templates, and event vocabularies for cross-project reuse. Accessed via `memory_*` tools (namespace-routed).

## Verification

```bash
bash plugins/ruflo-ddd/scripts/smoke.sh
# Expected: "10 passed, 0 failed"
```

## As a mod

Since this version the plugin is also a function-hook mod (ADR-445 pattern; needs Claude Code 2.1.287 or later). It never calls the network or spawns a process, and it only tightens: it can refuse a call, never allow one.

- **Guard** (default on): refuses domain-model memory writes (`ddd-*` keys and `context:`/`aggregate:` hierarchy edges) that hold a key, token or password. The reason names the kind of secret, never the value.
- **`/ddd-mod`**: answered locally, no model turn: `status`, `scan <text>` (would the guard refuse this?), and `contexts` (folders under `src/`, `src/contexts`, `src/modules` with a `domain/` layer).
- **Status file**: `.claude-flow/ddd-mod/status.json` (`{version, updatedMs, guard, blocked}`), written at session start and when a call is blocked.
- **Option**: `guard` (`on` | `off`, default `on`) in the plugin's `userConfig`.

Test it: `claude plugin test plugins/ruflo-ddd` and `bash plugins/ruflo-ddd/scripts/smoke.sh`.

## Native Codex hooks

The separate `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` selects `hooks/codex-hooks.json`, replacing
the Claude-only module entry for Codex. Claude's manifest and `register.ts` remain
unchanged. The synchronous native `PreToolUse` adapter bundles the existing pure
guard and shared secret screen; it preserves their tool/namespace scope and emits
the native permission-denial envelope before a guarded write. `SessionStart` and
guarded calls maintain private per-session counters in `PLUGIN_DATA`; the existing
version-1 project status file remains a best-effort courtesy view. Status failure
does not permit a denied write. Guarding is enabled for the native adapter.

Existing skills and command files remain available. Claude's dynamic
`$.command.register` / `command.run` mod interception has no native command-hook
equivalent: Codex does **not** get that interception. The same deterministic local
command helpers are available explicitly via
`node <plugin-root>/hooks/codex-hook.cjs --command status` (and the helper's existing
subcommands). This is guard/status compatibility, not full SDK-mod parity.

Maintainers rebuild the committed standalone bundles with
`ESBUILD=<esbuild executable> node scripts/build-codex-mod-hooks.mjs`, then run
`node --test tests/plugins/codex-mod-hooks.test.mjs`. Set `ESBUILD` in that test run
to check byte reproducibility using the same installed builder. Run
`scripts/sync-mod-screen.mjs --check` before bundling when the shared screen changes.
The adapters need Node.js and contain no runtime SDK dependency.

This source change requires a released upstream package or an explicitly owned
source projection to reach installations. It does not patch foreign cache entries,
pin upstream updates, disable plugins, or claim an already published repair.

Release both host manifests with the same patch version. Codex 0.160's published
remote-bundle sync skips downloading a release whose version equals the installed
version; merging same-version source does not establish automatic cache refresh.
Its explicit native plugin install replaces the cached root atomically even at the
same version. An owned projection must therefore refresh its upstream source
generation and explicitly reinstall it; refreshing a marketplace catalog alone
is not installation proof. No foreign cache entry should be edited in place.
