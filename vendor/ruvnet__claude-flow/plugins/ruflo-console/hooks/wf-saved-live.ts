/**
 * The Workflows page's saved views, live (ADR-461): reads `.claude-flow/console/wf-views.json` once per project, puts the
 * cursor back where it was when the runs have been read, and writes the file again when the cursor, a pin, a filter or the search
 * changed (at most once every SAVE_GAP_MS, one write at a time). The data rules are in data/wf-saved.ts; this holds the one
 * copy per project and the reads and writes, with the host's `fs` and `run` passed in so a test supplies its own.
 *
 * The write is the console's own state file: a fixed-argv `dd` or `install -D` (no shell; the text is stdin), about 1 kB, only under
 * `.claude-flow/console/` of the project, and the page says where the file is. Forgetting it goes through the confirm card.
