/**
 * What a workflow read changed that a person would want announced beyond what the page already says (ADR-460). The page's own
 * pass (wf-live.ts runNotices) announces a run that finished or failed; this adds what it does not: an agent that failed, an agent or
 * run that has gone quiet (the read's own `stale` / `stalled` judgement, STALE_MS without a transcript line), and, for an agent a
 * mission tagged (data/wf-links.ts), a finished one. Every function is pure and sees only two reads, so the first read announces
 * nothing. The ruflo swarm is folded into the page's run list after the read, so it never reaches here: only workflow runs do.
 *
 * Each change is returned twice, as a band notice draft and as a mission event, so the merge owner can record the second into the
 * mission ledger (`applyMissionEvents`) from the one place that holds the ledger. Text comes from labels, so it is washed first.
