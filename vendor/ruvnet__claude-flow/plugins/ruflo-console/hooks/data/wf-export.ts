 * A run summary as markdown (ADR-461): phases, agents, results and, where a figure exists, tokens, time and cost. Pure.
 * Every string that came from a file passes `cleanText` (control characters out, credential shapes masked) and has table
 * characters escaped, so a label cannot break a row and a token in a result cannot reach the summary. A figure nobody
 * recorded reads n/a: the console holds no per-run cost, so cost is shown only when the caller hands one over with its source.
